Blog posts and traditional assignments by first- 
and second-language writers 
Irina Elgort, Victoria University of Wellington 
Abstract 
This study investigates differences in the language and discourse characteristics of course blogs and 
traditional academic submissions produced in English by native (L1) and advanced second language (L2) 
writers. One hundred and fifty two texts generated by 38 graduate students within the context of the same 
Master’s level course were analysed using Coh-Metrix indices at the surface code, textbase and situation 
model levels. The two text types differed in their lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, use of cohesion 
and agency. Overall, the traditional course assignments were more formal, lexically sophisticated and 
syntactically complex, while the blog posts contained more semantic and situational redundancy, resulting 
in higher readability, and communicated a clearer sense of agency. There were also reliable differences 
between the textual artefacts generated by the L1 and L2 writers, one of which was a more traditional 
impersonal academic style of the L2 texts. Although no interaction was observed between the two 
independent variables in the Coh-Metrix analyses, an additional analysis of human ratings showed that the 
blog posts were rated lower on the use of language than traditional assignments for the L2, but not L1, 
writers. Limitations of the computational text analysis and pedagogical implications of the findings are 
considered.

Introduction 
Educational blogging is increasingly used in academia as a form of writing that facilitates student 
engagement with concepts and ideas, encourages deeper learning through reflection and peer feedback, and 
creates a clearer sense of audience (Bloch, 2007; Gallagher, 2010; Halic, Lee, Paulus, & Spence, 2010; 
Jimoyiannis & Angelaina, 2012; Murray, Hourigan, & Jeanneau, 2007). Blog, a social software tool that 
allows its author to easily post online individual text (or multimedia) entries displayed in reverse 
chronological order, was originally implemented and used outside of the education sector. Educational 
blogging arose as a result of the affordances of the tool to create new forms of audience, authorship and 
artefact (Warschauer & Grimes, 2007). 
Warschauer and Grimes (2007) emphasise agency in blogging, suggesting that successful blogs “tend to 
have a strong authorial voice” (p. 8). Blogs usually allow interactivity between the author and the audience, 
but these interactions are asymmetrical, with the blog’s author having control over topics, their 
interpretations, and whether or not to engage with the audience. Reader contributions to blogs tend to be 
limited to comments on author’s posts. Some blogs are written with a relatively small well-defined 
readership in mind, but in the blogosphere (i.e., blogs and their connections), a blog’s audience is essentially 
unlimited, “composed of anyone with a Web browser who could accidentally or intentionally come across 
a blog posting” (p. 8). Educational (course) blogs usually have a wider audience than traditional course 
submissions—that is, they are read by the students enrolled in the course as well as the teacher. The teacher 
Irina Elgort 53 
 
may also choose whether to keep course blogs restricted to those taking the course or to situate them in the 
broader blogosphere. 
Studies into first language (L1) and second language (L2) educational blogging tend to report positive 
effects of blogging on student motivation and willingness to write and, in some cases, on the quality of 
writing, especially when accompanied by peer feedback (Arslan & Sahin-Kizil, 2010; Aydin, 2014; Ciftci 
& Kocoglu, 2012; Lee, 2010; Sun, 2010; Sun & Chang, 2012; Vurdien, 2013). Some results, however, are 
less straightforward. Xie, Ke, and Sharma (2008) reported a positive effect of regular course blogging by 
L1 undergraduate students on the development of reflective thinking, and a positive correlation between 
students’ reflective thinking and their course grades. Interestingly, they also found that students who sent 
and received peer feedback on their posts tended to be less reflective than those who did not, and that peer 
comments tended to have a social function of communicating general support (e.g., “good job,” “I agree”), 
rather than engaging with ideas expressed in the posts. In another L1 undergraduate study, Lester and Paulus 
(2011) found that students were reluctant to take ownership of their academic views in their course blogs, 
resisting the position of a knowledgeable student in favour of an academic identity of a novice. Blog posts 
created by some students adhered to the conventions of traditional objective academic discourse, avoiding 
personal experience and beliefs. Lester and Paulus argue that this behaviour may have been caused by the 
combination of students having to publically display their knowledge (while not being sure of its quality) 
and their awareness of the wider readership of their blog posts, which they could not control (p. 680). 
Still, little is known at this stage about how written artefacts produced in academic blogging differ from 
those produced when students engage in traditional, essay-style academic writing. In a recent study with 
undergraduate-level L1 sociology students, Foster (2015) used comparative content analysis to investigate 
student writing in private journals and course blogs (i.e., low-stakes writing assignments), focusing on 
reflection depth and engagement with course materials. The main finding of the study highlights an 
important difference in the kind of content generated by the students in these two writing modes: students 
took more intellectual risks when blogging (e.g., developing a personal theory) and more personal risks 
when writing in private journals (e.g., reflecting on a personal misconception). This and similar studies 
(e.g., Gallagher, 2010; Jimoyiannis & Angelaina, 2012; Sun & Chang, 2012) show pragmatic effects of the 
writing mode but, to my knowledge, there are no studies that compare textual (micro) features of student 
writing in blogs and academic assignments, for L1 and L2 authors (Hinkel, 2011). The present study 
therefore examines language and text features of course blogs and traditional course submissions by L1 and 
L2 students in the same university course. The study also investigates whether previously observed 
differences between L1 and L2 academic writing (Crossley & McNamara, 2011a, 2011b; Friginal, Li, & 
Weigle, 2014) are more prominent in essay or blog texts. 
Characteristics of the texts produced by L1 and L2 writers in blog posts and traditional course submissions 
in this study were obtained using language and discourse indices generated using a computation tool, Coh-
Metrix (Graesser, McNamara, Louwerse, & Cai, 2004). Graesser and McNamara (2011) suggest that the 
Coh-Metrix tool can be used “to acquire a deeper understanding of language-discourse constraints” (p. 
372). Coh-Metrix provides indices at the level of the text, paragraph, sentence, and word and can be used 
to analyse L2 writing (e.g., Crossley & McNamara, 2012) as well as L1 writing (e.g., Graesser et al., 2014; 
McNamara, Crossley, & McCarthy, 2010). The Coh-Metrix tool generates indices corresponding to the first 
three levels of the five-level taxonomy of discourse representation (Graesser, Millis, & Zwaan, 1997) that 
includes the surface code, explicit textbase, situation model, discourse genre or rhetorical structure, and 
pragmatic communication levels (Graesser & McNamara, 2011). The surface code level indices are related 
to the language per se, such as words and syntax. The textbase level indices are related to explicit expression 
of meaning and ideas, such as explicit propositions and links between them, as well as inferences that 
connect these propositions. The situation model refers to the subject matter of discourse and reflects 
causation, intentionality, time, space, and protagonists (McNamara, Graesser, McCarthy & Cai, 2014). 
Since its introduction, Coh-Metrix has been used in studies investigating the cohesion and linguistic 
sophistication of texts, comparing different types of discourse (e.g., spoken and written discourse, narrative 
and informational or expository texts, textbooks and research publications, integrated and independent 
54 Language Learning & Technology 
 
essays), and studies comparing L1 and L2 writing (Crossley & McNamara, 2012; Graesser, Jeon, Yang, & 
Cai, 2007; Guo, Crossley, & McNamara, 2013; Louwerse, McCarthy, McNamara, & Graesser, 2004). 
Literature Review 
Coh-Metrix Analyses of L1 and L2 Writing 
Crossley and McNamara (2012) investigated features of L2 English academic essays related to cohesion 
and linguistic sophistication at the surface, textbase, and situation model levels in order to identify variables 
that distinguish between higher- and lower-proficiency L2 writers. The essays were sourced from the Hong 
Kong Advanced Level Examination corpus; they were written by graduating high school students in Hong 
Kong and graded by groups of trained raters from the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority 
(p. 119). From the Coh-Metrix indices (for descriptions of individual indices, see the Coh-Metrix website 
or McNamara et al., 2014), organised into banks relevant to text cohesion and linguistic sophistication at 
each of the three levels of analysis, Crossley and McNamara first selected 14 indices that were most highly 
correlated with human scores. After performing a linear regression analysis, they identified the following 
five variables, the combination of which accounted for 30% of the variance in the essay evaluation training 
set (and 21% in the test set): lexical diversity, content word frequency, word meaningfulness, average of 
word familiarity and aspect repetition. 
Similar to previous research (e.g., Ferris, 1994; Grant & Ginther, 2000), the surface code and textbase 
variables were the main predictors of L2 essay scores in this study, with highest graded L2 texts 
characterised by a higher degree of lexical diversity and lower word frequency, meaningfulness, and 
familiarity values. On the other hand, highly scored L2 essays in this study had less aspect repetition (i.e., 
a cohesion variable at the situation model level). This finding is counter to the claim that aspect (and tense) 
repetition is used by L2 writers to increase text cohesion (Duran, McCarthy, Graesser, & McNamara, 2007). 
Similarly, the use of two other cohesion variables (given vs. new information and positive logical 
connectors, e.g., and, also, then) was negatively correlated with essay ratings, suggesting that less cohesive 
academic texts were scored higher by trained raters. In fact, linguistic indices related to cohesion were not 
found to be good predictors of human judgements of essay quality across a number of L2 and L1 studies 
(for an overview, see Crossley & McNamara, 2011b). 
In an L1 English study, McNamara et al. (2010) reported that Coh-Metrix indices of syntactic complexity, 
lexical diversity and word frequency were most predictive of writer proficiency for argumentative essays 
written by undergraduate university students. Essays written by L1 students were scored higher when they 
had more syntactically complex constructions (with more words before the main verb), more lower-
frequency words, and a greater range of lexical diversity. 
Coh-Metrix Analyses of Different Types of Academic Writing 
The Coh-Metrix tool was used to compare writing quality of integrated and independent essays in the Test 
of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL iBT) (Guo et al., 2013). Based on previous studies that examined 
linguistic features predictive of L2 writing proficiency in independent and integrated essays (Cumming et 
al., 2005; Ferris, 1994; Grant & Ginther, 2000), Guo et al. (2013) used computational indices of lexical 
sophistication, syntactic complexity, cohesion, and text length in their analysis of TOEFL iBT essays 
written by 240 English as a Second Language (ESL) and English as a Foreign Language (EFL) test-takers. 
The Coh-Metrix indices of linguistic features successfully predicted human scores for both types of essays. 
Text length (in words) was the strongest predictor of the human scores for both text types, with longer 
essays attracting higher ratings. Two other significant predictors of the human ratings common to the 
integrated and independent essays were the use of past participle verbs (indicative of the use of passive 
voice) and word frequency (measured by linguistic indices of frequency, familiarity, and average syllables 
per word). Essays with more instances of past participle verbs were graded higher due to passive voice 
being associated with more formal academic writing style (Hinkel, 2002). Higher-rated essays were also 
characterised by the use of lower-frequency words—a sign of lexical sophistication. 
Irina Elgort 55 
 
Guo et al. (2013) also found differences in the predictive features for the two types of essays. The integrated 
essays (written as compare and contrast texts in response to two formal sources of information) were scored 
higher when they were written in a more detached style, marked by greater semantic similarity between 
sentences and the use of third person singular present forms. The quality of the integrated essays was also 
judged higher when they contained more instances of referential cohesion (semantic similarity, noun 
overlap, and tense repetition), presumably due to the need to integrate and compare information from two 
separate sources. This was not the case for the independent essays that were argumentative texts based on 
test-takers’ prior knowledge and personal experiences and views. The latter were graded higher when fewer 
cohesive devices were used (i.e., fewer conditional connectives, less aspect repetition, and less content word 
overlap). Thus, studies, in which the Coh-Metrix tool was used to generate linguistic and discourse indices, 
show that computational measures can be used to predict L1 and L2 writing proficiency and distinguish 
between different writing tasks. 
The Study 
The goal of the present study is to compare language and text (micro) features of the two kinds of written 
artefacts produced by the same students enrolled in the same postgraduate course: academic blog posts and 
academic assignments. Since blogs are gaining momentum as a learning and teaching tool, their educational 
affordances for L1 and L2 academic writing need to be understood and built upon. By comparing textual 
features of blogs and assignments while controlling for the author and topic variables, differences (if any) 
between the two academic writing modes can be better understood. This understanding can then be used to 
predict how educational blogging may affect student writing practices and assist in making informed 
decisions on whether or not to use course blogs in tertiary education. So far, it appears that research into L1 
educational blogging (e.g., Foster, 2015) focuses primarily on the macro-level of discourse (ideational, 
epistemological, pragmatic, and socio-cultural content). L2 writing research, on the other hand, tends to 
compare the effect of blogging and more traditional forms of ESL or EFL written assignments on student 
achievements in criterion-based writing tests, scored by human markers or raters (e.g., Lin, Li, Hung, & 
Huang, 2014). Conversely, the present study puts the focus of the investigation squarely on the nature of 
the textual artefact. 
Linguistic and discourse aspects of student-generated texts are examined in order to address the following 
research questions (RQs): 
1. Do academic blog posts and traditional assignments generated by students taking the same 
university course differ in their language and discourse characteristics? 
2. Do academic texts generated by L1 and advanced L2 writers within the same university course 
differ in their language and discourse characteristics? 
3. Are differences associated with the two text types more apparent in the artefacts produced by L1 
or L2 writers? 
Participants 
The study was conducted with students taking a 10-week post-graduate course in Computer-assisted 
Language Learning (CALL), as part of the Master’s programme in Applied Linguistics and Teachers of 
English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). The texts included in the study were collected over three 
years, from 38 consenting students: 11 high-proficiency L2 speakers (from countries in East and Southeast 
Asia) and 27 L1 speakers of English. Each year’s cohort consisted of on-campus and distance students. 
Data Collection and Analysis 
Materials 
The course included a number of assessed written tasks: (1) regular reflections on course readings in the 
form of blog posts open to the course instructor and students (about 500 words per entry), and (2) traditional 
56 Language Learning & Technology 
 
essay-style written assignments submitted as document files to the instructor only. One of these assignments 
was a literature-informed software resource evaluation, and the other was a project design document that 
included a literature-informed project justification section (used in this analysis). The course blog was 
created using the Campus Pack blog tool integrated into the university online course web site. Students 
could create and edit their own blog entries and comment on entries from other students. They could 
subscribe to updates via email and RSS feeds. 
Two samples of the two types of writing by each student (152 texts) were used in the study: 76 traditional 
assignments (ASGN) and 76 blog posts (BLOG). The two blog posts chosen for each student were those 
closest in length to 500 words. Essay-style texts used in the analysis were one or more consecutive whole 
sections of the assignments, as close as possible in length to 500 words. The selected texts (across the two 
types) were on average 565 words long (Min = 354; Max = 778), with a standard deviation of 81 words 
(less than one half of average length, as recommended in McNamara et al., 2014). For one-paragraph 
excerpts from sample L1 and L2 student submissions, see Appendix A. 
Text Preparation 
All texts were anonymised and tagged for language (L1 or L2) and text type (ASGN or BLOG). The data 
cleaning procedure was based on that used by McNamara et al. (2014). Spelling errors were corrected. The 
following elements were deleted from the text: sentences with long citations (i.e., quoted text), in-text 
citations in parentheses, tables, and figures. Bulleted lists were converted into one sentence with a 
semicolon as a separator. Course-specific abbreviations were replaced with full text (e.g., A2 was replaced 
with assignment 2). 
Statistical Analysis 
First, computational indices at the surface, textbase, and situation model levels were generated for each text 
using the Coh-Metrix tool, and theoretically and empirically motivated indices (based on the Coh-Metrix 
studies outlined in the introduction; see also McNamara et al., 2014) were selected for the initial analysis 
(see Appendix B). After this, averages per index were calculated for individual writers for each submission 
type, so that each student had two values for each index: one for the BLOG type and one for the ASGN 
type. Where non-normal distributions were observed, index values were logarithmically transformed to 
bring them closer to normality. Highly-correlated indices (r > .7) within each level of analysis were 
identified, and only one index per correlated set was used in the analysis, in order to avoid collinearity 
(Crossley & McNamara, 2012). 
A separate Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was conducted for the surface, textbase and 
situation model levels, with relevant Coh-Metrix indices used as dependent variables in each analysis. To 
investigate differences between the two text types and the L1 and L2 writers, the independent variables of 
interest in this study were text type (BLOG or ASGN) and language (L1 or L2). The Wilks’ Lambda test 
statistic was used in all MANOVAs. The Least Significant Difference (LSD) statistic was used in post-hoc 
pairwise multiple comparison tests (Crossley & McNamara, 2011a). An alpha level of .05 was used for all 
reported analyses. 
Human Ratings 
The texts used in the study were also rated by two human raters with prior experience in teaching or marking 
academic writing and with advanced university degrees in applied linguistics. The texts were rated on a 7-
point scale on three criteria corresponding to the levels of the Coh-Metrix analysis: (1) use of language, (2) 
explicit textbase, and (3) situation model (see Appendix C). Each rater was allocated half of the texts (n = 
76) using a pseudo-random approach, such that they rated an equal number of the two text types written by 
L1 and L2 writers.

Results 
Descriptive Statistics 
The total number of paragraphs index was not included in the analysis due to a high correlation with the 
average number of sentences in each paragraph. The final analysis of variance included the following 
descriptive indices: total number of sentences in the text, total number of words in the text, the average 
number of sentences in each paragraph and the standard deviation for number of sentences per paragraph. 
The MANOVA showed no reliable difference between L1 and L2 texts (F(4,69) = 1.42, p = .24, ƞ2p = .08) 
across all indices, although the L1 texts used in the analysis were on average about 30 words longer than 
the L2 texts. The difference between the two text types (BLOG and ASGN) in the MANOVA was reliable 
(F(4,69) = 6.25, p < .001, ƞ2p = .27). On average the ASGN texts were longer than BLOG texts by 46.34 
words (SE = 14.26; p < .01) and by about 4 sentences (SE = 1.15; p < .01). The BLOG texts had on average 
about one sentence more per paragraph than the ASGN texts (SE = 0.09; p < .05). There was no interaction 
between the two variables (F < 1). 
Surface Code 
Nine indices were used in the surface code analysis. Three indices indicated syntactic complexity: words 
before the main verb of the main clause in sentences, modifiers per noun-phrase, and syntactic structure 
similarity between all adjacent sentences. Six indices represented lexical sophistication: average word 
frequency for content words, age of acquisition (i.e., at what age a word tends to be first used by a native 
speaker; e.g., the word smile has a lower age of acquisition index than the word dogma), concreteness, 
imagability (i.e., how easy it is to construct a mental image of the word), meaningfulness (defined in terms 
of the number of associations a word has with other words, e.g., the word people has a high Coh-Metrix 
meaningfulness score of 612 and the word abbess, a low meaningfulness score of 218), and hypernymy for 
nouns and verbs. Hypernymy indices indicate a relative location of a word within a conceptual hierarchy 
of superordinate and subordinate words. For example, the word entity (that has a low hypernymy value) is 
at the top of a conceptual hierarchy and is more abstract; the word chaise (high hypernymy value) is at the 
bottom of the hierarchy (with many levels above it, i.e., chair, seat, furniture, artefact, object) and is more 
concrete and specific. High hypernymy values may reflect more formal words, for example, Golden 
Retriever sounds more formal compared to dog or animal in a sentence, “I drove the Golden Retriever to 
the doctor's office” (Crossley, Salsbury, & McNamara, 2009, p. 311). 
The MANOVA showed reliable effects of the text type (F(9,64) = 7.32, p < .001, ƞ2p = .51) and language 
(F(9,64) = 3.67, p < .01, ƞ2p = .34) predictors, but no significant interaction between them (F < 1). For the text 
type variable, the post-hoc tests showed that essay-style assignments were more syntactically complex than 
blogs posts, based on the mean number of modifies per noun-phrase (see Table 1). The syntactic structure 
similarity between adjacent sentences was greater in essay-style assignments than in blog posts. Lexical 
sophistication was higher in the traditional assignments than in the blogs; in the ASGN texts, the average 
word frequency for content words was lower and more content words that a native speaker would be 
expected to acquire later in life were used. On the other hand, the average ratings for concreteness and 
imagability were higher in the ASGN than in the BLOG texts. In addition, the hypernymy values for nouns 
and verbs were higher in the essay-style submissions. 
For the language variable, the post-hoc tests showed that L2 writers produced more syntactically complex 
texts than L1 writers, based on the mean number of words before the main verb and the mean number of 
modifies per noun phrase. The L2 writers, however, used more similar syntactic structures compared to the 
L1 writers (Table 2). The L2 writers produced texts that were less lexically sophisticated: they used words 
that scored higher on meaningfulness, concreteness, imagability, and noun and verb hypernymy.

Textbase 
Seven indices were used in the textbase analysis: one index of lexical diversity (vocd lexical diversity 
measure for all words) and six cohesion indices. One of the cohesion indices, global noun overlap, was 
related to referential coherence (or co-reference), that is, the noun overlap of each sentence with every other 
sentence in the text. The other five cohesion indices were related to connectives-based cohesion: causal 
connectives (e.g., because, so), logic connectives (e.g., and, or), temporal connectives (e.g., first, until), 
Irina Elgort 59 
 
positive connectives (e.g., also, moreover), and negative connectives (e.g., however, but). 
The MANOVA showed a reliable effect of the language variable (F(7,66) = 3.04, p < .01, ƞ2p = .24), but only 
a trend towards the text type effect (F(7,66) = 1.82, p = .098, ƞ2p = .16), and no reliable interaction between 
the two variables (F < 1). For the text type predictor, the post-hoc tests showed that two indices had a trend 
toward difference that did not reach conventional reliability (see Table 3). Referential cohesion via global 
noun overlap was higher in the essay-style assignments than in the blog posts. On the other hand, somewhat 
fewer temporal connectives were used in the ASGN than in the BLOG texts.

Note. a The score for causal connectives has been shown to discriminate between the high and low cohesion texts (see 
McNamara et al., 2014). 
For the language variable, the post-hoc tests showed that compared with L1 writers, L2 writers produced 
text that was higher in explicit cohesion, as a result of using more causal and logical connectives (see Table 
4).

Situation Model 
10 indices were used in the situation model analysis. Two of them were semantic overlap indices based on 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA; Landauer et al., 2007): the mean of the LSA cosines between adjacent 
paragraphs (measure of semantic similarity in the high-dimensional word-by-context LSA matrix) and the 
average givenness of each sentence (information available for recovery from the preceding discourse). One 
index was that of word part-of-speech (i.e., the number of personal pronouns per 1000 words). Four were 
syntactic pattern density indices: the incidence score of preposition phrases, the incidence score of agentless 
passive voice forms, the incidence score of gerunds, and the incidence score of infinitives. Three were 
60 Language Learning & Technology 
 
situation model indices: the temporal cohesion index based on the repetition score for tense and aspect, the 
causal content index based on the incidence of causal verbs and causal particles in text, and the causal 
cohesion index based on a ratio of causal particles to causal verbs. 
The MANOVA showed reliable effects of the language (F(10,63) = 4.18, p < .001, ƞ2p = .40) and text type 
(F(10,63) = 13.61, p < .001, ƞ2p = .68) predictors, but no significant interaction between them (F(10,63) = 1.16, 
p = .33, ƞ2p = .16). The post-hoc tests for the text type variable (see Table 5) showed that the BLOG texts 
had significantly more instances of personal pronouns per 1000 words and gerund than the ASGN texts, 
and more semantic overlap in adjacent paragraphs. The ASGN texts also had more incidents of agentless 
passive voice forms and higher repetition scores for tense and aspect.

For the language variable, the post-hoc tests (see Table 6) showed that the L2 writers produced texts that 
were higher in referential cohesion than those produced by L1 writers: the L2 texts had more semantic 
overlap in adjacent paragraphs and a higher proportion of given (vs. new) information. The texts generated 
by the L2 writers had more instances of agentless passive voice forms. The L2 writers used more gerunds, 
infinitive forms, causal verbs, and particles in their writing than L1 writers.

Analysis of the Human Ratings 
The ratings of the use of language, textbase, and situation model were used as dependent variables, while 
the text type (ASGN or BLOG) and writer language (L1 or L2) were used as primary-interest predictors 
(i.e., independent variables). For each rater, the ratings were first standardised and centred using the scale() 
function in R. 
Linear mixed effects modeling using the lmer function (Bates, 2011; Bates & Sarkar, 2010) of the 
interactive programming environment R was used in the analyses of the ratings. In the regression analyses 
of the data, t-values larger than 2 indicated a significant effect at p < .05 (Baayen, 2008). The study 
participants were included in the model as random effects. A separate model was constructed for each rating 
criterion. A minimally adequate statistical model was fitted to the scaled ratings data, using a stepwise 
variable selection and the likelihood ratio test for model comparisons (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008). 
On the use of language criterion (corresponding to the surface code level in the Coh-Metrix analysis), the 
analysis showed reliable effects of both text type and writer language, and a reliable interaction between 
the two predictors (see Table 7, section A). The blog posts were rated lower than traditional assignment for 
L2 writers, but this was not the case for the L1 writers (Figure 1). The texts produced by the L1 writers 
were rated higher than those produced by the L2 writers on this criterion. The findings for the human ratings 
of language use were mostly aligned with the Coh-Metrix analysis at the surface code level: the text type 
and writer language were found to be reliable predictors in both analyses. However, the interaction between 
the two predictors was only observed in the analysis of human ratings.

On the textbase criterion, the analysis of ratings (see Table 7, section B) showed a reliable effect of writer 
language (the L1 texts were rated higher than the L2 texts), but the effect of text type was not statistically 
reliable, and there was no interaction between the two predictors. A similar pattern was observed in the 
Coh-Metrix analysis at the textbase level, where the effect of writer language was reliable, but only a weak 
trend was observed for the text type variable. Finally, the analysis of human ratings on the situation model 
criterion showed a reliable effect of writer language (in favour of the L1 texts), but not text type (Table 7, 
section C), and no interaction.

Discussion 
The analysis of the written artefacts produced by the students taking the same graduate course showed that 
educational blogging and traditional essay-style course assignments differ in some language and discourse 
characteristics (RQ1). The traditional academic texts were more lexically sophisticated, that is, they 
included more lower-frequency vocabulary and words that are acquired by native speakers later in life.1 
The assignment submissions were also more syntactically complex than the blog posts (as indicated by the 
number of modifiers per noun-phrase). Since Coh-Metrix linguistic indices of lexical sophistication and 
syntactic complexity are predictive of human judgements of essay quality (Crossley & McNamara, 2012; 
McNamara et al., 2010), the essay-style assignments in the present study may be expected to attract higher 
human ratings than the blogs (because the assignments were shown to be more lexically sophisticated and 
syntactically complex). This was the case for L2, but not L1 writers (see Figure 1) presumably because the

quality of a blog post is judged differently than that of an academic essay due to the nature of the two text 
types. 
Guo et al. (2013) reported that there were differences in the language and discourse features predictive of 
human ratings for integrated and independent essays. The integrated (but not independent) essays were 
scored higher when they had a higher degree of referential cohesion (through noun overlap and tense 
repetition). Similarly, compared to the blogs, the assignments in the present study were characterised by 
greater referential cohesion via global noun overlap and more repetition of grammatical tense and aspect. 
Furthermore, the integrated essays were scored higher when they were written in a more formal, detached 
style. The assignments in the present study were also more formal than the course blog posts, as indicated 
by the use of agentless passive voice and higher hypernymy values for nouns and verbs (i.e., preference for 
more specific, formal words). They also had more similar syntactic structures, characteristic of more formal 
texts (Graesser et al., 2014). 
The independent essays that incorporated the writers’ personal experiences and points of view (Guo et al., 
2013) were scored higher when less content overlap and less aspect repetition was used. Similarly, the blog 
posts (across the two groups of writers in the present study) were characterised by less referential cohesion 
and less repetition of grammatical tense and aspect. On the other hand, the blogs included more instances 
of semantic and situational redundancies that contribute to text readability and ease of understanding and 
communicated a clearer sense of agency, containing more personal pronouns and fewer passives. 
These language and discourse differences between the two text types were observed in the artefacts 
produced by L1 or L2 writers (RQ3). However, the L2 writers were less able than the L1 writers to achieve 
the same quality of writing in their course blogs as in traditional academic assignments; L2 writing was 
scored lower by human raters on blog posts than on assignments (Figure 1). This suggests that the L2 writers 
may have found moving away from the familiar impersonal academic writing style to a relatively unfamiliar 
style of education blogging challenging. 
In summary, the analysis of text types shows that, compared to the essay-style assignments that adhered to 
a more formal, complex, impersonal, and repetitive academic style, educational blogging was less formal, 
less formulaic, less semantically and syntactically complex, and easier to understand. Blogging also created 
a clearer representation of agency. Thus, the written artefacts generated by the students on similar topics 
within the same course differed as a result of the medium used to create these texts and an expectation of a 
broader readership. Moreover, these differences were observed in the Coh-Metrix analysis for both the L1 
and L2 writers, suggesting that the effect of writing medium occurs when writing in the first and second 
language. However, the blog posts generated by the L2 writers were rated lower by the human raters than 
their traditional course assignments, suggesting that the quality of writing suffered when the L2 writers 
were writing outside of the more familiar, formal academic writing mode. This effect did not occur for L1 
writers, whose blog texts were rated at about the same quality as their essay-style course submissions, in 
terms of language use. 
The present study also explored differences between the writing of L1 and L2 postgraduate students, across 
academic writing and academic blogging (RQ2). Friginal et al. (2014) showed both similarities and 
differences in the use of linguistic and discourse features (and clusters of features) in highly rated L1 and 
L2 texts (for overviews, see Crossley & McNamara, 2011b; Hinkel, 2011). However, more research is 
needed in this area, as results so far are limited and inconclusive (Friginal et al., 2014). Hinkel (2011) also 
points out that L2 writers’ language proficiency is a common confounding factor in research comparing L1 
and L2 writing. The present study shows a number of differences in the use of language and discourse 
structures in the written artefacts generated by the L1 and advanced L2 writers. 
Across both text types, the L2 writers produced more syntactically complex texts than the L1 writers, but 
used more similar syntactic structures and more meaningful, concrete, and imagable words (i.e., words that 
were less lexically sophisticated). They also used words that had higher hypernymy values, associated with 
more formal discourse (Ordonez, Carlo, Snow, & McLaughlin, 2002). Furthermore, previous studies have 
64 Language Learning & Technology 
 
shown that lexical development is associated with an increased depth of lexical networks and ability to use 
abstract language, corresponding to a decrease in hypernymy values (Crossley et al., 2009). Therefore, the 
finding that texts of L2 writers had higher hypernymy values may also indicate their lower lexical 
proficiency compared to the L1 writers. This conjecture is supported by the finding that, similar to previous 
studies (Crossley & McNamara, 2011b), the L2 texts were reliably less lexically sophisticated than L1 texts. 
The L2 writers produced texts that were higher in textual and situational cohesion in comparison with the 
L1 writers. They used more causal and temporal connectors, more causal verbs and causal particles, and 
more semantic overlap in adjacent paragraphs. L2 writing also contained a higher proportion of given (vs. 
new) information. Higher values of cohesion indices in previously published Coh-Metrix analyses have 
been negatively correlated with human raters’ scores of academic writing (Crossley & McNamara, 2012, 
2011b). Thus, the texts produced by the L2 writers in the present study were predicted to attract lower 
ratings than those of the L1 writers. This was indeed the case in the analysis of human ratings on the textbase 
and situation model criteria. Finally, the finding that the L2 writers’ texts had more incidents of agentless 
passive voice forms suggests that they were more inclined to use impersonal academic writing style than 
the L1 writers, across both text types (Hinkel, 1997). This result corroborates the proposed reasons why L2 
student blog posts were rated lower than their assignments. 
Limitations 
The Coh-Metrix analysis of differences between course blogs and traditional assignments has produced 
interesting and novel findings, but an additional linguistic analysis of the two text types by a human 
researcher may be able to further explain and interpret some of these differences. For example, the different 
hypernymy values may be interpreted in a number of ways relative to the basic category word (Brown, 
1958; Murphy, 2004). That is, in relation to the basic level word car, the word vehicle will have a lower 
hypernymy index and be considered a more abstract concept, and the word sedan will have a higher 
hypernymy index and be considered a more specific, formal word (Crossley et al., 2009). In the present 
study, higher hypernymy values are interpreted to represent a more formal style. However, hypernymy 
indices used in Coh-Metrix are based on the WordNet database (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, & 
Miller, 1990) and provide values in absolute taxonomic hierarchies rather than values relative to the basic 
category word in each hierarchy. Therefore, the findings and conclusions based on the Coh-Metrix 
hypernymy indices can only be tentative. Another example of a limitation in the ability to interpret a 
computational-only analysis is the syntactic complexity measure—words before the main verb. This is 
because syntactic complexity may indicate a more sophisticated manner of academic writing (i.e., higher 
essay quality) or a less skilled use of syntactic structures in communicating ideas and arguments (i.e., lower 
writing quality). The relationship between computational measures of syntactic complexity and human 
ratings of writing quality depends on the genre and mode of writing, chosen topic, and task (Crossley & 
McNamara, 2014; Crowhurst, 1983; Lu, 2011; Yanga, Lub, & Cushing Weigle, 2015). However, when 
combined with the results for other indices within the same level of analysis and conceptual groupings of 
linguistic and discourse features, valid interpretations of computational indices can be achieved. 
Pedagogical Implications 
This study has shown that the choice of writing environment affects the resulting written artefact, for L1 
and L2 university students, even when academic writing on similar topics is undertaken within the same 
course. Educational blogging encouraged a less formal approach to academic writing with a clearer sense 
of agency and increased text readability (Gallagher, 2010; Sun & Chang, 2012). Language teachers and 
instructional designers may therefore benefit from carefully considering consequences of using blogs in 
academic courses. Using traditional assignments is likely to better prepare students for situations when they 
need to comply with academic or professional certification standards or meet university admission 
requirements. On the other hand, if the goal is to broaden the students’ academic writing repertoire, 
adjusting the style of writing to the target audience and utilising affordances of different communication 
Irina Elgort 65 
 
modes, providing opportunities to engage in educational blogging is clearly worthwhile (Bloch, 2007; 
Foster, 2015; Jimoyiannis & Angelaina, 2012; Lee, 2010). This is particularly critical for L2 writers, who 
tend to use more formal, impersonal language in their academic writing (Hinkel, 1997; Hyland, 2002). 
Conclusions 
This study examined language and discourse features of course blogs and traditional assignments by L1 
and advanced L2 university students completing an advanced degree in applied linguistics and TESOL. 
Students enrolled in the same postgraduate course were instructed to write blog posts and traditional essay-
style assignments on the topics covered in the course. This design made it possible to compare and contrast 
micro-features of the two text types generated by the same students at the surface code, explicit textbase, 
and situation model levels of discourse representation (Graesser et al., 1997). The computational analyses 
revealed reliable differences between the two text types at the surface and situation model levels. The 
textual artefacts of course blogging were less lexically sophisticated and syntactically complex than those 
of the assignments, were written in a less formal style, and had higher readability and a clearer sense of 
agency. These findings suggest that educational blogging creates opportunities for students to develop an 
academic writing style they can use to communicate complex ideas in a more informal manner to wider 
audiences—a valuable attribute of a university graduate. Based on the quality ratings of the two text types 
by human raters, it appears that the educational blogging task is more challenging for L2 students, whose 
native academic writing norms and L2 training may encourage more formal impersonal writing style. This 
conjecture should be investigated in future research into L2 blogging.

Notes 
1. The assignments had more concrete and imagable words than the blogs. Although the latter finding 
may appear counter-intuitive, it makes sense if we consider that the two traditional assignments 
required the students to design or evaluate a learning task, tool, or programme (a more concrete subject 
matter), while the blog posts were discussions of course readings, primarily journal articles.

Appendix A. Excerpts from One L1 and One L2 Student Texts 
 Text type = BLOG Text type = ASGN 
L1 If we want our students to be able to engage in 
CALL effectively, they need to be able to do so 
not only in the computer lab or at home with 
their PCs, but whenever they have the urge or the 
opportunity. The ideal as I see it is to create 
seamless technology - for the tools that learners 
use for language input, output and interaction to 
be easy and intuitive. It is already thus for much 
of social networking and therefore shouldn't be 
such a stretch for it to become so for the various 
language learning resources. Additionally, as 
[author] notes, a tool ought to be matched 
appropriately with the task at hand. In many (but 
not all) cases the [technology] is an ideal way to 
facilitate this. 
This language learning tool provides 
authenticity in what it does. The focus is on 
accuracy and complexity, but fluency practice 
will occur outside of the program. Perhaps the 
biggest weakness is that it does not allow 
learners to engage in extended conversation 
outside of the discussion boards. User feedback 
is an important part of [software] and it is still a 
relatively new tool, so it can be expected that it 
will continue to evolve, adding components 
(within the translating framework) that will 
further enhance language learning. This 
program is recommended for anyone wishing 
to study a new language, particularly as a 
learning strategy tool within a largely 
autonomous learning approach.

L2 One of the main points of [source] about 
computer-mediated communication (CMC) is the 
actual role of CMC in the second language 
classroom. According to the authors, one of its 
noticeable innovatory roles compared with 
traditional L2 classrooms is its ability to involve 
learners in a mobile classroom with either 
synchronous or asynchronous interaction through 
which to negotiate meaning. [Author], cited by 
[author], proved that the language produced in 
the electronic discussions can be lexically and 
syntactically more complex than that of face to 
face interaction. It is true that with CMC, turn-
taking can be distributed more equally among 
learners. Also, within asynchronous tools, 
learners can have time to perform more 
thoughtfully and coherently. Sharing the same 
idea about CMC role, [author] suggests that it 
helps assisting the process of collaborative 
learning by creating a new domain for both 
teacher and learners. 
The three aspects of "language difficulty", 
"program difficulty" and "content" belonging 
to both syllabus and learner variables have to 
some extent been already discussed throughout 
the paper. By selecting some random reading 
texts and transcripts to analyse in [software], 
the language difficulty is proven to be 
compatible to these learners' language 
competence as more than 95% coverage are 
within 5000 level and low frequency words are 
rarely found. About "program difficulty", it can 
be suggested that [software] can hardly cause 
any technical problem to users as it is free and 
accessible for everyone to download materials 
within a couple seconds. Audios in mp3 format 
and texts in pdf are very accessible to users. 
One limited point about the site is that some 
activities have not been updated lately. 
However, as some overlapped ideas can be 
noticed between the old activities and the 
newly released ones, it can be because the site 
designers want to replace some tasks with the 
newer ones.

Appendix C. Rating Criteria and Descriptors for Human Raters 
1. Use of Language (Surface Code) 
Descriptor. Appropriate and effective use of linguistic resources: (1) appropriate and effective use of syntax 
(arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences); (2) appropriate, precise and effective 
use of vocabulary; (3) lexical sophistication. 
The rating of 7 (highest rating) is assigned when the writer uses a wide range of vocabulary and grammatical 
structures fluently and flexible to convey precise meaning; the language shows natural and sophisticated 
control of lexical and syntactic features.  
The rating of 1 (lowest rating) is assigned when the writing shows an extremely limited range of vocabulary 
and grammatical structures; little control of lexical, grammar and syntactic features; sentences are poorly 
constructed; the writing does not convey precise meaning. 
2. Textbase 
Descriptor. Local and global coherence: (1) effective use of cohesive devices (e.g., linkers, referents) within 
and between paragraphs; (2) well-formed paragraphs; (3) clear and logical structure; (4) logical sequencing 
of information and ideas. 
The rating of 7 (highest rating) is assigned when the writer uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no 
special attention, creating logical, natural and fluent flow of written discourse. Paragraphing is skilfully 
managed. 
The rating of 1 (lowest rating) is assigned when a very limited range of cohesive devices is used, and those 
used may not convey causal or logical relationship; there is very little control over organisational features; 
poor use of paragraphing. 
3. Situation Model 
Descriptor. (1) Communication of agency, causality, intentionality; (2) quality of inferences, elaborations, 
idea development; (3) the writing supports the creation of a mental model of the situation or argument by 
72 Language Learning & Technology 
 
the reader. 
The rating of 7 (highest rating) is assigned when the writing creates a clear mental representation of the 
situation / context in the mind of the reader; presents a clear, fully developed position supported by fully 
extended and well developed ideas and argumentation.  
The rating of 1 (lowest rating) is assigned when the writing does not create a mental model of the situation, 
process or argument; does not express a position; may attempt one or two ideas but there is no development; 
the ideas are not logically organised; there is no clear progression.

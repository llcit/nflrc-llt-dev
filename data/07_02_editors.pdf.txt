FROM THE EDITORS
Welcome to Volume 7, Number 2 of Language Learning and Technology.
Julie A. Belz has done an outstanding job guest editing this special issue on
telecollaboration in conjunction with Associate Editor Rick Kern. We hope you find it
interesting and useful.
At this time, we would like to recognize three Editorial Board members who have been
with the journal since the first issue back in 1997 and whose terms of service have now
come to an end. We extend our deepest gratitude to Anna Uhl Chamot, Martha Crosby,
and Joan Jamieson for their many years of assistance. And, as we rotate members off, we
also are pleased to bring new members on. We welcome Lourdes Ortega and Susana
Sotillo to the Board. Both Dr. Ortega and Dr. Sotillo have been active supporters of the
journal for years and are well known for their research in applied linguistics.
Sincerely,
Mark Warschauer & Dorothy Chun
Editors
Pamela DaGrossa

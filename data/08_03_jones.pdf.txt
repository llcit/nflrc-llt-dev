TESTING L2 VOCABULARY RECOGNITION AND RECALL USING
PICTORIAL AND WRITTEN TEST ITEMS

University of Arkansas
ABSTRACT
This article describes two studies that examined the effects of pictorial and written annotations on
second language (L2) vocabulary learning from a multimedia environment. In both studies,
students were randomly assigned to one of four aural multimedia groups: a control group that
received no annotations, and three treatment groups that provided written, pictorial, or both
written and pictorial annotations while listening. In the first study, students in the three treatment
groups recognized English translations or pictorial representations of French keywords better than
the control group that received no annotations during listening. In the second study, students
produced English translations of French keywords best when the mode of testing matched the
treatment mode. These results add to the growing body of literature on the beneficial effects of
annotations on L2 vocabulary recognition and recall.
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, media-based listening comprehension activities have evolved from a purely audio-only
approach to one that is more holistic and multi-sensory. No longer are materials focused on nonsensical
sentence structures. Instead, students now experience lengthier, authentic audio passages embedded in
video, interactive CD-ROMs, or Web sites. Numerous computer-based and online packages have been
developed by researchers, faculty, and publishing companies (Amon, Muyskens, & Omaggio Hadley,
2000; Chun & Plass, 1997; Larson & Bush, 1992; Otto & Pusack, 1992; Sabo, Restrepo, & Jones, 2000;
University of Texas, 2001, 2004) to assist students' L2 aural and written development. Français Interactif
(University of Texas, 2001, 2004) is one of the more innovative on-line French language learning
programs produced in recent years. It provides multiple levels of semester-long instruction with a mixture
of multi-sensory materials such as aural, pictorial, video, and written presentations that help students to
learn the target language. Interactive self-checking exercises provide them with an opportunity to examine
their output in terms of recall of the target language material. Cyberbuch (Chun & Plass, 1997), another
innovative program on CD-ROM, provides advance organizer videos and annotated information to
support students' reading of a German text. This highly focused program promotes interaction with multi-
sensory annotated information in the form of text translations, images, short video clips, and audio to
facilitate students' understanding of keywords and the literary texts.
As the development of L2 multimedia packages such as Français Interactif and Cyberbuch increases,
researchers strive to better understand how the attributes of multimedia can enhance listening and reading
comprehension and vocabulary acquisition (Brett, 1995, 1997; Hoven, 1999; Jones & Plass, 2002; Lynch
1998; Salaberry, 2001). For example, Chun and Plass (1996) examined the influence of written and
pictorial annotations on students' vocabulary learning from a written text whereas Jones and Plass (2002)
examined their influence on vocabulary learning from an aural text. Other researchers, for example
Doughty (1991) and Pica, Doughty, and Young (1986) studied the effects of student control over the L2
multimedia environment, while researchers such as Herron (1994) and Herron, York, Cole, and Linden
(1998) have closely examined the influence of advance organizers on L2 learning. Despite these
advances, many questions remain concerning the effects of multimedia components on students' L2
development.

This article expands upon previous research (Jones, 2003; Jones & Plass, 2002) by describing two studies
that used three separate vocabulary tests (written recognition, pictorial recognition, and written recall) to
examine how pictorial and written test items might demonstrate how well written and pictorial
annotations assist in the learning of new vocabulary when students listen to an aural L2 passage in a
multimedia environment. The present article examines this topic. It begins with a review of the role of
written and pictorial annotations in L2 reading and listening comprehension, of the process of incidental
vocabulary learning, and of the different methods and tests used to examine students' vocabulary
recognition and recall. The article concludes with a discussion of the findings, the implications and
limitations of this study, and suggestions for future research.
VOCABULARY LEARNING FROM ANNOTATIONS
Information is cognitively processed through visual or verbal channels (Mayer, 1997, 2001, 2002; Paivio,
1986). A dual processing strategy assumes that individuals develop mental pictorial representations of
graphic input and mental verbal representations of linguistic input. The presence of both pictorial and
verbal cues can facilitate learning, in particular when the corresponding visual and verbal representations
are contiguously present in working memory (Mayer, 1997, 2001, 2002; Wittrock, 1989). Mayer's
generative theory of multimedia learning (1997, 2001) states that in order to meaningfully comprehend a
text in a multimedia format, learners must select relevant pictorial and/or linguistic information from it,
organize the input into coherent visual and verbal mental representations, and then integrate the latter by
constructing referential connections between the two.
Researchers have long been interested in examining the effects of pictorial and verbal cues on L2
vocabulary learning, and have found that processing supportive information such as pictures or
translations enhances language learning. With regard to high-imagery concrete vocabulary learning,
Kellogg and Howe (1971) found that foreign words associated with images or actual objects are learned
more easily than those without such additional information. Terrell (1986) found that combining an
unknown L2 word with a visual representation bypasses a direct translation and facilitates vocabulary
learning. Underwood (1989) suggested that we "remember images better than words, hence we remember
words better if they are strongly associated with images" (p. 19). Other research suggests that foreign
words associated with aural or written translations and images are learned more easily than are those
accompanied by pictures or text alone (Baltova, 1999; Guillory, 1998; Jones & Plass, 2002; Oxford &
Crookall, 1990; Plass, Chun, Mayer, & Leutner, 1998). For example, Oxford and Crookall (1990) suggest
that the combination of pictures and text accesses more parts of the brain, thereby leading to greater depth
of processing than when text is processed alone. Baltova (1999) examined the effects of viewing a French
video with either French audio and French subtitles (bimodal format), or English audio and French
subtitles (reversed format) on students' vocabulary learning. She found that students learned significantly
more vocabulary when they viewed the audio-visual material with both French subtitles and French audio
present than in the reversed format where they viewed the video with English audio and French subtitles.
Incidental vocabulary learning is the process of acquiring vocabulary while reading or listening for
comprehension rather than focusing solely on memorizing lists of words (Hulstijn, 1989; Hulstijn,
Hollander, & Greidanus, 1996; Yoshii & Flaitz, 2002). Any incidental vocabulary learning that occurs in
a multimedia environment may depend upon the type of annotations processed, and the depth of
experience with them. For example, Hulstijn, Hollander, and Greidanus (1996) examined how the
presence of glosses for targeted words, or dictionary lookup of words in a written text, might affect
incidental vocabulary learning. They found that incidental learning of words frequently occurring in the
text was more likely when learners were provided with access to word meanings through marginal glosses
or dictionaries than when no helpful information was made available to them. Hulstijn (1992) determined
that deep elaboration of the meaning of an unknown word also led to incidental vocabulary learning.
Jones (2003) found that students believed that pictures demanded deeper processing than did verbal

translations because they had to "figure out" the meaning which they did not have to do if they saw the
translation immediately. Quantitative results confirmed her beliefs: Students who accessed pictorial
annotations demonstrated greater incidental vocabulary learning than those who did not access this
annotation type. Other researchers found that if the context of a written or spoken passage was not clear
from the onset, deeper processing might fail to support incidental vocabulary learning, and students who
do not have access to annotated information would run the risk of learning words incorrectly (Chun &
Plass, 1996; Hulstijn, 1992; Jones, 2003; Jones & Plass, 2002).
Recognition and recall tests are often used to examine students' vocabulary knowledge. However, test and
measurement studies indicate that these two forms of testing are quite different and demand separate
processing strategies (Cariana & Lee, 2001; Jonassen & Tessmer, 1996). For example, recognition tests
usually involve multiple choice activities whereby learners select or guess the correct response from the
alternatives given. Such tests may strengthen any existing memory traces (McDaniel & Mason, 1985).
Recall, on the other hand, demands the production of responses from memory. It is more difficult than
recognition because learners must search for the correct response within their mental representation of the
newly experienced information (Cariana & Lee, 2001; Glover, 1989; McDaniel & Mason, 1985).
Several studies have investigated the use of pictorial and written annotations in L2 multimedia reading
and listening comprehension using different testing formats (Chun & Plass, 1996; Jones & Plass, 2002;
Plass et al., 1998). Plass et al. found that when students accessed both pictorial and written annotations as
they read a multimedia-based German text, they scored higher on a written vocabulary production test
than when only one annotation type was accessed. The combination of both annotation types allowed for
more than one retrieval route to the information in long term memory. These researchers also found that
written annotations had a stronger impact on vocabulary production than did pictorial annotations. Jones
and Plass (2002) reported that those students who accessed both pictorial and written annotations as they
listened to a multimedia-based aural French text performed better on a written vocabulary recognition test
than those who accessed single annotations, or no annotations at all. However, unlike subjects in the Plass
et al. study, those who accessed pictorial annotations alone or combined with written annotations
outperformed those who did not access pictorial annotations on a written vocabulary recognition test.
Chun and Plass (1996) further examined the effects of multimedia annotations on L2 vocabulary learning
from a reading passage using a written production and a recognition test with a balance of pictorial and
written test items that paralleled the modality in which the information was presented. They, too, found
that students performed best on both types of tests when both pictorial and written annotations were
viewed than when single or no annotations were accessed during reading. They also observed that when
the method of testing more closely paralleled the way in which information was presented, student
performance improved considerably, resulting in 77% of correct responses on immediate and delayed
vocabulary tests, a percentage much higher than the 23%-55% typically expected in select-definition tests
(Knight, 1994).
All of the above studies suggest incidental vocabulary learning can be increased if learners are given
opportunities to look up word meanings, visually or verbally, while listening or reading. However, none
of these studies specifically examined students' incidental vocabulary learning from a listening
comprehension activity using vocabulary tests that complemented or ignored the annotation type
accessed.
The following two studies, therefore, investigated how pictorial and/or written annotations affect students'
performance on incidental vocabulary learning tests that required them to either recognize or recall
vocabulary incidentally learned from an aural text, using pictorial or written test items. Three hypotheses
are thus proposed that coincide with the three dependent measures used in this study and introduced in the
next section:

1. Students with access to pictorial and written annotations during a L2 listening comprehension activity
will recognize more written translations of keywords on a written vocabulary recognition posttest than
those with access to one type of annotation, or no annotations at all. In addition, students who access
written annotations will outperform those without such access on a written vocabulary recognition
posttest.
2. Students with access to pictorial and written annotations during a L2 listening comprehension activity
will recognize more pictorial representations of keywords on a pictorial vocabulary recognition posttest
than those with access to one type of annotation, or no annotations. In addition, students who access
pictorial annotations will outperform those without such access on a pictorial vocabulary recognition
posttest.
3. Students with access to pictorial and written annotations during a L2 listening comprehension activity
will recall more keyword translations on a written vocabulary production posttest than students with
access to only one type of annotation or no annotations. In addition, students who access written
annotations will outperform those without access to such annotations on a written vocabulary production
posttest.
THE PRESENT STUDIES
Method
Participants, Study 1
Eighty second-semester English-speaking beginning students of French, enrolled at the University of
Arkansas in the fall of 2001, voluntarily participated in the study during their regular class time. The
students completed a 25-item vocabulary recognition pre-test to determine their prior knowledge of the
vocabulary in this study. All students demonstrated low prior knowledge of the vocabulary with an
average score of 4 out of a maximum score of 25 (M = 4.04, SD = 3.60; Table 1). A Tukey HSD (honestly
significant difference) multiple comparison test showed no significant differences among the four groups.

Participants, Study 2
Sixty seven second-semester English-speaking beginning students of French, enrolled at the University of
Arkansas in the spring of 2002, voluntarily participated in the study during their regular class time. They
completed a 25-item pre-treatment vocabulary recognition test based on the words used in this study and
demonstrated low prior knowledge of the vocabulary with an average score of 1.5 out of 25 (M = 1.57,
SD = 1.23; Table 2). A Tukey HSD multiple comparison test showed no significant differences among the
four groups.

Materials and Apparatus for Studies 1 and 2
Four aural multimedia treatments, developed using Adobe Premiere 4.2 (Adobe, 1994) and Authorware
4.0 (Macromedia, 1997), were presented to students using a 24-station Macintosh computer lab, arranged
so that the students could view only their own computer screens.
All groups first saw an opening screen that instructed them how to use the program and provided an
advance organizer in the form of a brief written paragraph that placed the aural passage about an
important event in its historical context (Figure 1). This screen provided additional instructions to assist
students with the annotations available in their respective treatments.
Figure 1. Example of the opening screen which provides instructions and advance organizer information,
based on the treatment, prior to listening to the aural passage
The opening screen was followed by five separate listening comprehension screens tailored to each
treatment. Within each screen, students could click on audio buttons to listen to a 2 minute and 20 second
aural passage (Buzhardt & Hawthorne, 1993; see Appendix A). Twenty-seven French keywords,
including nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbial phrases, were chosen by two experienced French
professors for their importance to understanding the story. They were placed in order of appearance on
the left side of each screen. To hear their pronunciation, listeners dragged the keywords to a speaker icon
in the upper right section of the screen.
In the control group, students could only listen to the pronunciation of French keywords (Figure 2).

Students could select any annotation available in their treatment at any time before, during, or after each
aural segment. A login script tracked the number of annotations accessed and the amount of time spent on
each.
The written English translations of the French keywords were presented in a bold, 14-point Helvetica
font. The color drawings and photos were pictorial representations of the same French keywords
(Appendix B). The pictures were selected based on a pilot study conducted in the summer of 1999 and
were used in two subsequent studies (Jones, 2003; Jones & Plass, 2002). While all written annotations
provided exact English translations of the French keywords, pictorial annotations may not have precisely
represented the meaning of some low-imagery French keywords such as étouffé (smother).
Dependent Measures and Scoring
Not all posttests were conducted in both studies since they were originally meant to study unrelated
issues. However, the results of these two studies warranted a combined analysis, albeit not a full one.
In Study 1, two dependent variables examined the effects of the four treatments on students' L2 incidental
vocabulary learning. The multiple choice written vocabulary recognition and pictorial recognition tests
were administered immediately after the treatment and again three weeks later (Appendix C). They
consisted of 25 of the 27 French keywords described above. The maximum score for each test was 25
with each correct response worth one point. The written vocabulary recognition pre- and posttests were
identical. In these multiple choice tests, students had six English translations to select from for each test
item. The pictorial vocabulary recognition posttest provided five pictorial representations to select from
for each test item.
In Study 2, a written vocabulary production posttest (Appendix D) was used to examine the effects of the
four treatments on students' vocabulary learning both immediately after the treatment and 3 weeks later. It
consisted of 25 of the 27 French keywords used in each treatment, and required students to provide their
English translations from memory. The maximum score for this test was 25, with each correct response
worth one point.
Procedures for Studies 1 and 2
A pre/posttest control group design was used to observe the effects of the absence or presence of written
and pictorial annotations on students' L2 vocabulary learning from the aural passage. All activities took
place during three separate class periods of a normally scheduled French class. During the first class
period, students had 8 minutes to complete the written vocabulary recognition pretest. Two days later,
each participant was randomly assigned to one of four treatments: (1) no annotations (2) pictorial
annotations, (3) written annotations, and (4) pictorial and written annotations. Students were given 14
minutes to listen to the passage and to access the annotations. Students in Study 1 then had 8 minutes
each to complete the written and the pictorial recognition posttests. Students in Study 2 had 8 minutes to
complete the immediate written vocabulary production posttest. Three weeks later, without any additional
experience with the aural passage and without prior warning, students in both studies completed the
delayed vocabulary tests that were identical to the tests given immediately after treatment.

Post hoc comparisons (Tukey HSD) showed that the written annotations group did not differ significantly
from those with access to both annotation types. The written annotations group and the pictorial and
written annotations group had significantly higher scores than the control group (p<0.001). There was no
significant difference between the pictorial annotations group and the written and pictorial annotations
group. The difference between the pictorial annotations group and the control group was also not
significant.
In terms of time on task, students in the pictorial and written annotations group did not access both
annotation types with equal frequency: Pictorial annotations were accessed 37% of the time with an
average of 7.01 seconds per annotation; written annotations were accessed 63% of the time with an
average of 8.23 seconds per annotation. However, both annotation types were viewed for almost equal
amounts of time by the single annotation groups: 10.98 seconds for pictorial and 11.21 seconds for
written annotations.
In summary, the control group performed the poorest on both posttests. On the immediate written
vocabulary production posttest, subjects who accessed both annotation types or written annotations alone
outperformed those without access to written annotations. On the delayed test, the written annotations
group retained more vocabulary than all other groups, while the pictorial annotations group did not differ
significantly from the control group. Those who had access to written annotations alone or combined with
pictorial annotations significantly outperformed those who did not have access to any written annotations.
DISCUSSION
Hypotheses 1 and 2 predicted that students with access to pictorial and written annotations during a L2
listening comprehension activity would recognize more written translations and pictorial representations
of keywords on written vocabulary and pictorial vocabulary recognition posttests. These two hypotheses
further predicted that students who accessed written annotations would outperform those without access
to such annotations on the written vocabulary recognition posttest, while students who accessed pictorial
annotations would outperform those without access to such annotations on the pictorial vocabulary
recognition posttest.
The results of the immediate vocabulary recognition tests did not support these hypotheses because
students recognized vocabulary equally well, regardless of test mode. Within recognition tests, there is an
inherent ability to guess built into the testing format. Thus, previous exposure to the translation, either
visually or verbally, makes selecting the correct response much easier than if one is asked to produce a
response from memory (Cariana & Lee, 2001; Glover, 1989; McDaniel & Mason, 1985).
Hypothesis 3 predicted that students with access to pictorial and written annotations during a L2 listening
comprehension activity would recall more vocabulary on a written vocabulary posttest than those without
access to both annotation types, and also that students who accessed written annotations would
outperform those without access to such annotations. Results of the immediate vocabulary production test
show that the pictorial and written annotations group and the written annotations group recalled more
vocabulary than did those without access to written annotations. This is in line with the third hypothesis
and demonstrates that students learned more vocabulary when the testing mode employed matched the
mode accessed, either alone or combined with an additional annotation mode.

With regards to all three hypotheses, the control group performed the poorest because the difficulty of the
aural text prevented students from building contextual knowledge, thus lessening their ability to learn
vocabulary incidentally (Hulstijn, 1992; Jones, 2003; Jones & Plass, 2002). On the other hand, vocabulary
acquisition was consistently strong when students had access to pictorial and written annotations, thus
supporting a multimedia effect proposed by Mayer (2001). The ability to look up words more than once in
different modalities supported inferencing and verification strategies (Grace, 1998) and, reinforced
learning (Chun & Plass, 1996), so that students were able to perform well on immediate tests regardless
of testing mode. Additionally, students could establish direct connections between the L1 and L2
vocabulary and the corresponding images and thereby have two instead of just one retrieval route (Plass et
al., 1998). However, with regard to the third hypothesis, students in the pictorial and written annotations
group may have had too much information to look up and may have foregone examining both annotation
types (Jones, 1995). Tracking logs showed that the pictorial and written annotations group did not
examine the two types of annotations in a balanced manner, and this group subsequently performed
poorer on the delayed written production test compared to the written annotations group. Though this
group initially obtained a richer and redundant amount of information that was immediately helpful for
producing written translations, with time, the retained information may have become "cluttered" and
inhibited the students' ability to focus directly on the needed responses due to cognitive overload
(Sweller, 1994).
Some researchers have argued that images carry a structural message that complements the language
presented (Baggett, 1989; Kozma, 1991) and that the pictorial mode facilitates vocabulary learning
(Kellogg & Howe, 1971; Oxford & Crookall, 1990; Underwood, 1989). This was the case in the study
conducted by Jones and Plass (2002) in which students who accessed pictorial annotations alone or
combined with written annotations outperformed those without access to any pictorial annotations on a
written vocabulary recognition posttest. In the present study, students performed well no matter which
annotation type was accessed. However, the pictorial annotations group could not produce vocabulary
from memory as well as those groups that had access to written annotations, a result counter to findings
that the pictorial mode of information increases the efficiency of learning (Kost, Foss & Lenzini, 1999;
Oxford & Crookall, 1990; Terrell, 1986). Instead, images may have provided too much information
(Sweller, 1994) rather than the more precise information provided by direct translations.
There are more connections in the memory representation when the input is visual. "Brown leaf"
presented verbally creates the instance of "leaf" connected with the concept "brown." But
showing a picture of a brown leaf causes one to create the concept of leaf connected with
concepts of brown, olive, rust, burgundy, etc., not to mention its shape, size, environment, etc. In
the verbal presentation there is one sure connection: leaf with brown. (Baggett, 1989, p. 119)
The richness of images may have affected students' ability to accurately translate L2 words into L1, while
written annotations provided precise definitions of the L2 words.
CONCLUSION
One limitation of this research is that it included two different studies with two different groups.
Originally, these studies explored unrelated questions but once analyzed, the findings in terms of the
influence of annotation types and testing modes on students' incidental vocabulary learning warranted a
joint report. Further comparative analyses to determine the impact of pictorial and written annotations on
pictorial and written testing modes was not possible since the two studies involved different subjects. An
additional limitation is that both studies focused on a between-subjects design. A within-subjects
examination may show how choice of annotation types affects students' performance on different
vocabulary tests. Additional research should also consider the ordering of the tests. In Study 1, the
pictorial recognition test was always administered before the written recognition test. Future examination
using these two tests could be strengthened by counterbalancing their order.

Language Learning & Technology 135
These studies offer several implications for language teaching and multimedia design. They add to the
growing body of literature on the beneficial effects of annotations on L2 vocabulary recognition and
recall. The ability to review information more than once reinforces learning (Chun & Plass, 1996), and
since students rely on different modalities to learn efficiently in different ways (Ehrman, Leaver, &
Oxford, 2003; Oxford & Ehrman, 1995; Plass et al., 1998; Reinert, 1976), providing them with an
opportunity to choose the mode of information they prefer may help them better learn the vocabulary
presented. Multimedia environments that provide both pictorial and written modes of keyword
information may be most effective for learning because the students can choose the mode that best suits
their needs and learning preferences (Plass et al., 1998).
Future research is needed to examine issues related to the outcomes of these studies. For example, a more
comparative approach to examining the connection between testing mode and annotation mode seems
warranted. Further study is also needed to address the issues of cognitive load and the role it may play in
long term memory for vocabulary when students access both pictorial and written annotations. Future
study should also examine the recall of vocabulary in an aural mode rather than a written mode to
determine how well aural L2 vocabulary comprehension is developed in an aural multimedia
environment. And finally, to address vocabulary acquisition, researchers should examine students' ability
to produce newly acquired vocabulary in a more challenging communicative context.
APPENDIX A
Text of Listening Comprehension Passage
LaSalle Meets the Quapaws (1682)
On fit traverser les canots sur la gauche à une pointe de sable. On se retranche le mieux que l'on peut avec
des petits bois de tremble, qu'on coupa, dont on fit des palissades. La brume se cessa, et l'on vit un canot
de Sauvages venir à nous …. Mais voyant qu'on ne leur en tirait point, ils s'en retournèrent chercher dire
que c'étaient des gens de paix. Ils revinrent 6 sans armes avec le calumet de paix faisant signe qu'on
vienne à leurs habitations. Ils présentèrent à fumer à M. de LaSalle et à tous ceux qui étaient autour de lui
disant toujours qu'on s'embarque …. Le lendemain les guerriers et la jeunesse dansèrent le calumet. C'est
de s'assembler tous sur la place. Les guerriers mettent leur présents sur des perches comme quand on veut
faire sécher du linge. Ils apportent deux grands calumets enjolivés de plumes de toutes couleurs et pleins
de cheveux de leurs ennemis. Ils mettent tout cela entre les mains de leurs chefs qui sont assis sur leurs
culs et arrangés autour de la place. Ils ont tous des gourdes pleines de cailloux et des tambours qui sont
des pots de terre. Ils commencent une chanson qu'ils accompagnent du bruit de leurs instruments. Les
guerriers qui ont fait de belles actions vont danser et frapper un poteau avec leurs casse-tête et disent les
belles actions qu'ils ont faites …. cependant les chefs fument, l'un après l'autre dans les calumets, et
chacun le présentait à M. de LaSalle et à tous ceux dans la compagnie. Après, ils le prirent et le placèrent
au milieu de la place, dansant tous autour de lui au son des instruments et chansons, chacun lui mettant
sur le corps son présent qui étaient des peaux de boeufs qui ont de la laine comme nos moutons d'Europe.
Si les Français ne l'avaient pas déchargé à mesure de ses peaux, ils l'auraient étouffé sous leurs présents. Il
leur fit à son tour présents de haches, couteaux, et rassades.

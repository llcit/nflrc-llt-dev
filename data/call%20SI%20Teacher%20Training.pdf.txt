Call for Papers: Teacher Training and CALL
Special Issue Editors: Nike Arnold and Lara Ducate
While educational policy (United States Department of Education, 2010), professional standards
(Healey, Hanson-Smith, Hubbard, Ioannou-Georgiou, Kessler, & Ware, 2011; National Council for
Accreditation of Teacher Education, 2008), and students (Pew Internet and American Life Project, 2002)
have all stressed the need to integrate technology into schools, actual implementation is unfortunately
sometimes lagging behind (American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages, 2011) as teachers
are often not ready to make (effective) use of CALL technologies and methodologies (Oxford & Jung,
2007). After considerable research on teacher attitudes and beliefs regarding CALL, the field is now at a
point where we need to address another crucial factor affecting the degree and quality of implementation:
teachers’ CALL competencies and knowledge base. This necessity is evident in the recently published
TESOL Technology Standards (Healey et al., 2011). While some teachers now receive CALL training
(American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages, 2011), it is not always adequate or effective
(Hubbard, 2008; Kessler, 2006; Kılıçkaya, 2009)—a main reason why CALL is not used to its full
potential (Healey et al., 2011). In fact, new teachers themselves have reported worryingly high levels of
dissatisfaction with their preparation (Kessler, 2006; National Education Association, 2008). Therefore,
teacher educators have begun to think anew about the nature of CALL training and education (Garrett,
2009; Hubbard & Levy, 2006). This special issue of Language Learning and Technology addresses the
question of how to prepare (future) L2 teachers to make effective use of CALL, with particular focus on
developing teachers’ skills and competencies and the content and format of CALL training/education.
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
•

Longitudinal studies on L2 teachers’ preparation for and use of CALL in their classrooms
How L2 teachers’ skills and knowledge are shaped by academic coursework and informal learning
The role and effectiveness of national or international standards on teacher training in CALL, such as
those by TESOL, NCATE, and the Council of Europe
Effective training formats for promoting CALL competencies and knowledge
Limitations of CALL training and how to address them
Development of teachers' skills, competencies, and knowledge base
Connections between training and teachers' CALL implementation
Factors that complement/affect training and the development of competencies/knowledge and how to
address them

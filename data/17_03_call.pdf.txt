Call for Papers: Digital Literacies and Language Learning 
 
Special Issue Editors: Christoph Hafner, Alice Chik, and Rodney Jones 
As digital media have become ever more pervasive in our lives, the concept of digital literacies—the 
skills and abilities needed to read, write, and communicate in digital media—has gained prominence 
(Jones & Hafner, 2012; Knobel & Lankshear, 2007). In part, the unique affordances that digital tools offer 
for communication are leading to a rethinking of fundamental concepts of L2 literacy and language 
education. At the same time, digital literacy practices play an increasingly important role in the lives of 
English language learners, with the virtual world of digital media now making up a very important 
context for L2 learners (Chik, 2012; Thorne & Black, 2008). In the context of L1 literacy development, 
there have been calls for integrating digital literacy practices in formal settings (see Davies & Merchant, 
2009; Gee & Hayes, 2011; Selwyn, 2013). In L2 contexts, the issue of digital literacies has received much 
less attention. This special issue will address the challenges of digital literacies in language teaching and 
learning, with a focus on both the independent digital practices of L2 language learners as well as 
innovative pedagogical applications for such practices in classroom contexts. 
Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 
• Language learners’ use of new forms of digital expression and digital literacy practices, e.g.: 
o Computer-mediated communication 
o Critical literacies online 
o Collaborative writing online 
o Blogs and wikis 
o Multimodal storytelling utilizing digital video/images 
o Social networking sites 
o Digital gaming 
o Virtual worlds 
o Remixing and mash-ups 
o Sharing and commenting in participatory communities 
• Digital practices of language learners outside the classroom 
• Digital practices and language teaching pedagogy 
• New roles and identities of language learners in digital media 
• Gender and digital practices 
Please consult the LLT Website for general guidelines on submission (http://llt.msu.edu/guidelines/

only descriptions of software or pedagogical procedures without presenting in-depth empirical data and 
analysis on language learning processes or outcomes will not be considered.

The current study investigated the effects of different computer-supported cooperative 
prewriting strategies (text-based brainstorming, drawing, and mind mapping) on the 
writing performance of elementary-school EFL (English as a foreign language) learners in 
Taiwan. Three intact classes of fifth graders (N = 81 students; 27 per prewriting strategy 
group) participated in this study. These subjects in different classes used different 
prewriting strategies at the prewriting stage. A quasi-experimental design was adopted in 
this study to collect experimental data, including the scores of English composition (two 
writing works), the level of grammar knowledge, and the level of English writing 
motivation. The analytical results indicated that in both the mind mapping group and the 
drawing group, the participants’ English grammar knowledge had increased significantly 
after the treatment. It was also found that different computer-supported cooperative 
prewriting strategies benefited young EFL writers in different dimensions of English 
composition. The influence of using the mind mapping strategy seems most powerful on 
young EFL writers, followed by the drawing strategy and the text-based brainstorming 
strategy. As to English composition motivation, almost all of the participants appreciated 
the computer-supported cooperative prewriting activities and were also aware of how 
these activities benefited their English writing.

INTRODUCTION 
Writing is important for the instruction of second-language (L2) learners because it is not only an 
effective tool for the development of academic language proficiency and a vital skill for academic or 
occupational success, but it also allows L2 learners to raise their awareness of knowledge gaps 
(Warschauer, 2010). Additionally, writing is one kind of linguistic output that helps L2 learners notice a 
gap between what they want to say/write and what they can say/write, leading them to recognize what 
they do not know, or know only partially (Swain, 1995). Writing is an active, constructive process of the 
mind by which the writer creates meaning (Berthoff, 1981; Dechant, 1993, p. 72). It is also an interactive 
process that takes place between the writer and the reader via the text. Unfortunately, writing is also one 
skill that is difficult for L2 learners to master (Warschauer, 2010).  
The writing process itself involves brainstorming for topics of interest, gathering information, allowing 
Yu-Ju Lan, Yao-Ting Sung, Chia-Chun Cheng, and Kuo-En Chang Prewriting by EFL Learners

that information to settle into some sort of overall plan with some prewriting techniques, putting the 
words down on paper, consulting with and getting feedback from others (such as teachers or peers), and 
revising (Kroll, 2001; Richard-Amato, 1996). Additionally, from the perspective of “writing as a process” 
(Gower, Phillips, & Walters, 1995; Richard-Amato, 1996), the above-mentioned processes involved in 
the prewriting stage, including working with ideas, planning, and drafting, are important to the writing 
quality and performance of L2 students because not knowing where or how to start would frustrate writers, 
especially inexperienced writers. Thus, writing instruction should not only help students to become active 
writers who produce products with accuracy, good organization, and meaning in an interactive context, 
but also should include the instruction of techniques for encouraging students to get started (Holmes, 
2003; Kroll, 2001).  
Numerous studies have confirmed that writing should be included as an integral part of L2 activities in 
elementary schools (Ediger, 2001; Fountas & Pinnell, 1996; Kroll, 2001), and research has also indicated 
that the production of output based on structured input provided by the writing teacher will enhance both 
the linguistic accuracy and conveyance of meaning among early L2 writers (Swain, 2005; VanPatten, 
1996). It is highly desirable for students to achieve a balance between the accuracy and the conveyance of 
meaning in their writing. To cultivate citizens with a broader and more global perspective and 
competitiveness in the new era of globalization, English language is always highly valued as a prescribed 
course by elementary schools in many Asian countries, such as Taiwan and Singapore (Singapore’s 
Ministry of Education, 2010; Taipei City Government’s Department of Education, 2000). According to 
the Nine-Year Curriculum issued by the Ministry of Education, Taiwan (Taipei City Government’s 
Department of Education, 2000), writing instruction in elementary schools should be integrated with the 
teaching of the other three basic language skills: listening, speaking, and reading. However, current 
elementary-school English programs most emphasize listening and speaking, followed by reading. Little 
attention is paid to the implementation of writing instruction (Zhou, 2012), let alone the provision of 
integrative instruction in all four skills. Furthermore, because of the extremely diverse English level of 
students of English as a foreign language (EFL) and the limited teaching hours (Lan, Sung, & Chang, 
2007, 2009), writing instruction is usually omitted from regular EFL classes. Thus, many elementary-
school students in Taiwan are deprived of the opportunities to first experience using the prewriting 
techniques in order to be aware that they have several different ways to begin an assigned writing task, as 
suggested by Kroll (2001) and then produce writing output.  
To deal with the problems caused by the diversity of English abilities among students, computer-
supported cooperative learning (CSCL) has been approved as an effective approach for enhancing the 
degree to which Taiwanese elementary-school students work together in order to successfully reach group 
learning goals (Lan et al., 2007, 2009; Lan, Sung, & Chang, 2013). Cooperative learning is the 
instructional use of small groups for the purpose of allowing students to work together to maximize each 
other’s learning potential (Johnson & Johnson, 2004). In particular, it renews the confidence of low-
ability writers (Kirkpatrick & Cuban, 1998), enhances the literacy of L2 learners (Wepner & Ray, 2000), 
and improves writing quantity, quality, and revision efforts (Bangert-Drowns, 1993; Daiute, 1986; 
Goldberg, Russell, & Cook, 2003). Current technology also provides L2 learners with approaches for 
improving their writing by visualizing their thinking processes, and they allow teachers to better 
understand the learning and cooperative writing patterns of their students, which in turn allow the teachers 
to determine the best way to improve their own writing instruction. 
In response to the urgent need to improve the EFL writing performance of elementary-school EFL 
learners in Taiwan, the authors of the current study conducted a pilot study (Lan, Cheng, Chang, & Sung, 
2012) to investigate the effects of integrating the CSCL approach and the prewriting strategy on young 
EFL learners’ writing performance. It was found that the learners who worked together with their peers at 
the CSCL prewriting stages made more remarkable progress in English writing performance than did 
those learning with non-CSCL approach at the prewriting stages. However, in the pilot study mentioned 
Yu-Ju Lan, Yao-Ting Sung, Chia-Chun Cheng, and Kuo-En Chang Prewriting by EFL Learners 
 
Language Learning & Technology  136 
above, it was also found that different prewriting strategies [BR (text-based brainstorming), DR (drawing), 
and MM (mind mapping)] were used by almost the same number of elementary-school EFL learners in 
both of the paper-and-pencil-based group (non-CSCL) and the CSCL group. Therefore, only the effect of 
the CSCL approach was preliminarily confirmed, but not the further understanding of how different 
prewriting strategies might benefit elementary-school EFL learners’ writing performance and motivation. 
The current study was therefore designed to overcome this limitation by further comparing the effects of 
the three prewriting strategies with CSCL approach on young EFL learners’ writing performance and 
motivation. The findings of this study could serve as a reference foundation for EFL educators and first-
line teachers to design better writing instructions for elementary-school EFL learners.   
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Early Writing Instruction 
Children’s literacy development in an EFL context has gained increasing attention due to the growing 
number of Asia countries making English instruction mandatory from a young age (Ediger, 2001). In 
addition to L2 reading, which is always considered the most important skill for L2 learners in academic 
contexts (Grabe, 1991), early writing instruction is also becoming increasingly important (Holmes, 2003; 
Whitney et al., 2008). 
Writing is not an activity that merely copies someone else’s text or uses the prepared lists of words to 
create sentences or stories. It is a creation of meaning from one’s own intellectual and linguistic resources 
and activity (Berthoff, 1981). In all writing, learners need to concentrate on the process and the evolving 
product simultaneously (Murray, 1982). In early writing, interactive writing, guided by and performed by 
interacting with teachers (Fountas & Pinnell, 1996), such as the provision of charts, letters, poems, recipes, 
stories, and retold group experiences, can help children to develop speech-to-print correspondence, left-
to-right directionality, the concept of the word, word analysis, sound-to-print matching, letter formations, 
spelling patterns, capitalization, punctuation, and self-correcting (Fountas & Pinnell, 1996). Furthermore, 
the writing assignment should be carefully assigned, depending upon the students’ ages, needs, and 
proficiency levels. It is generally best to begin with short pieces of writing before proceeding to longer 
ones (Richard-Amato, 1996). Given that short stories describe personal experiences and that riddles are 
easy for teachers to provide writing models, story writing and riddle creation are usually assigned in early 
writing instruction to stimulate L2 writers to create interactive writing (Lan et al., 2012). 
Some studies have focused on prewriting strategies (e.g., Lin, 2010a; Xu, 2008) to English writing 
instruction in elementary schools in Taiwan, but few of them have revealed significant effects of 
prewriting strategy instruction on neither elementary-school students’ English writing performance 
(specifically writing quality) nor writing motivation. Furthermore, most of these studies have been paper-
and-pen-based, few are done with the support of technology, and cooperative writing activities have been 
virtually absent. Although technologies and cooperative learning have been shown to be effective for 
promoting the writing performance and writing motivation of learners (Bonk & King, 1998; Hayes & Ge, 
2008; Lingnau, Hoppe, & Mannhaupt, 2003), the results obtained from the studies mentioned above are 
far from satisfactory, especially the understanding of CSCL for writing instructions in the elementary 
schools in Taiwan. Therefore, more efforts should be made to take into account the value of CSCL for 
enhancing L2 writing in the EFL settings in the elementary school in Taiwan. 
Learning Strategies and Prewriting Strategy Instruction 
Learning strategies are actions performed by learners to aid the acquisition, storage, subsequent retrieval, 
and use of information (Dansereau, 1985). Additionally, L2 learning strategies are specific actions that L2 
learners use as tools for active and self-directed involvement to enhance their own L2 learning (Oxford, 
2003). Research has repeatedly shown that appropriate L2 strategies result in improved proficiency and 
greater self-confidence (Chamot, 2005; Hong-Nam & Leavell, 2006). After a certain amount of practice 
Yu-Ju Lan, Yao-Ting Sung, Chia-Chun Cheng, and Kuo-En Chang Prewriting by EFL Learners 
 
Language Learning & Technology  137 
and use, L2 strategies—like any other skills or behaviors—can become automatic. In a word, L2 
strategies can be taught and modified through strategy training (Lan, 2013). Thus, it is recommended that 
L2 strategy instruction should be included in language education (Oxford, 2003; RAND, 2002). 
A writing process can be roughly divided into three stages: before writing, while writing, and when 
revising (Petrić & Czárl, 2003). Prewriting strategies are the strategies used by L2 writers at the “before 
writing” stage for generating ideas to accomplish a writing task. Similar to quick sketches made by an 
artist before painting, prewriting strategies are used by L2 writers to test ideas, list ideas, and explore a 
range of topics for their writing. The importance of the prewriting stage lies in its vital role to help writers 
set their writing goals, brainstorm and organize ideas, as well as decide article structures (Flower & Hayes, 
1981), especially for the beginners who easily struggle with looking for the words they need, 
remembering grammatical conventions, and linking their ideas with coherence and producing appropriate 
L2 writing (Chamot, 2005). Therefore, the lack of this planning process might lead to poor writing 
performance. Research evidences also show that prewriting strategies help L2 writers save time by 
quickly determining which ideas are worth developing and improve writing performances (Saddler, 
Moran, Graham, & Harris, 2004). Given that L2 writing can be the most difficult modalities in which 
learners achieve communicative competence (Chamot, 2005), incorporating prewriting into regular L2 
writing instruction should be highly valued in L2 education. 
Additionally, for EFL children and inexperienced writers, L2 writing is a great challenge because they 
need to cope with the competing attention demands while writing, such as using the L2 writing system, 
deciding on content knowledge related to a writing topic, selecting proper vocabulary and grammar to 
form correct sentences, organizing sentences into a paragraph or even into a whole passage with good 
structure. All the demands above are extra burdens, overwhelming the limited capacity of young and 
novice writers’ short-term memory (Flower & Hayes, 1981). However, the prewriting stage is usually the 
most ignored part in the writing process.  
Although drawing (Lin, 2010a; Olson, 1992), mind mapping (Lin, 2010b; Pishghadam & Ghanizadeh, 
2006), brainstorming and listing (Kroll, 2001) are among the most used prewriting strategies in L2 
writing, they are usually implemented in paper-and-pencil- or individual learning-based approaches. How 
the integration of those prewriting strategies and the CSCL approach would benefit elementary-school 
EFL writers’ writing performance and motivation is worthy of further investigation.  
CSCL in Writing Instruction 
Technology-supported writing has been shown to improve the quality of work produced by students. 
According to the research findings obtained from word processing in writing instruction, students who 
wrote with the word processor on computers have improved the quality of their writings (Bangert-Drowns, 
1993) and have corrected more errors (Daiute, 1986). Results obtained from a five-year project of 
conducted in Maine with middle school students (Silvernail & Gritter, 2007) indicated that a one-to-one 
ubiquitous laptop program had a positive impact on middle school students’ writing. Furthermore, the 
evidence of the project also indicated that the participating students (more than 100,000 middle school 
students) became better writers in general, not just better writers using laptops. Another meta-analysis 
conducted by Goldberg et al., (2003) also supported the abovementioned research findings that students 
who use computers when learning to write are not only more engaged and motivated in their writing, but 
they also produce written work that is of greater length and higher quality. 
Additionally, when students write on computers, writing becomes a more social process by which 
students share their works with one another as compared with paper-and-pencil environments (Goldberg 
et al., 2003). These findings echo some educators’ claim that such an online environment is particularly 
appropriate for cooperative learning approaches that emphasize group interaction (Harasim, 1990). Bonk, 
Medury, and Reynolds (1994) also argued that computer-supported cooperative tools for student 
cooperation are elevating writing beyond silent and solitary activities to environments rich in discussion

and interchange. Some researches on CSCL for writing had approved the effects of CSCL on FL/L2 
writing, such as those conducted by Lingnau et al., (2003), Woo, Chu, Ho, and Li (2011), Hayes and Ge 
(2008), and Liu (2011).  
Lingnau et al., (2003) evaluated the effects of a cooperative writing task facilitated by a shared workspace 
system on the German writing performance of a group of first graders of non-native German speakers. 
Their findings showed that the outcomes of learning through cooperative activities are greater than those 
of learning through non-cooperative activities. Furthermore, they also indicated that children mostly 
refrained from seeking the teacher’s help during peer cooperation. Woo and her colleagues (2011) 
investigated how the 5th graders in Hong Kong used Wiki in the writing of English as a second language 
(ESL). They found that the students in their case study enjoyed using the Wiki in the team work and 
benefited from the collaborative writing activities.  Hayes and Ge (2008) used a mixed research method 
to investigate the writing performance of American fifth graders in a CSCL environment. The results 
showed greater gains in writing performance and motivation to write from the students using the software 
than from the control group using paper and pencil. Hayes and Ge’s study demonstrated the technological 
affordances of CSCL augment cooperative learning and showed the visualization of the individual’s 
thinking while posting ideas and interacting with one another in a knowledge forum. .  
Unlike the abovementioned research focusing on the CSCL approach for elementary-school students’ 
writing, Liu (2011) examined the effects of two types of computer-based concept maps, individual and 
cooperative, on the writing performance of 94 EFL freshmen with a variety of writing proficiencies. She 
found that the writing performance was significantly better for low- and middle-level learners using 
individual and cooperative computer-based concept maps than for those not using such maps, especially 
with respect to the argumentation traits. However, high-level learners performed better with the 
individual-mapping treatment than those with the cooperative-mapping treatment. Wu (2007) compared 
two types of group composition of 60 college students and the effects on cooperative learning of EFL 
writing, and found that the learning outcomes could be greatly improved when less-capable learners 
cooperated with more-capable learners in small-group learning activities. 
Taking a comprehensive view of the above-mentioned literature, it can be found that the participants of 
most of the studies were secondary or college students (Kuo, Wible, & Tsao, 2001, Liu, 2011; Wu, 2007). 
As indicated by Goldberg et al. (2003), computers had a greater impact on writing for middle and high 
school students than on elementary-school students, in terms of both the quantity and the quality of 
writing. The meta-analysis research conducted by Bangert-Drowns (1993) also showed that the 
participants of most studies (21 out of 28) on computers in writing were older than elementary-school 
students. However, the small portions of studies aimed at investigating CSCL for elementary-school 
students’ writing seem to go against the arguments made by Wepner and Ray (2000), who indicated that 
computer-supported writing tools offer several advantages that are not available with the traditional 
paper-and-pencil approach for young writers. The advantages of computer-supported writing include the 
use of prewriting prompts (like graphics, photographs, and questions that emerging piece of writing), the 
prewriting tools (like drawing tool, brainstorming area, and electrical note for collecting ideas), text-to-
speech tools, writing supports (like rhyming or picture dictionary), and writing mechanics (like spelling 
check) that encourage students to expand, revise, and edit their works (Wepner & Ray, 2000). Given that 
computer-supported writing is supposed to be helpful to elementary-school students’ writing, the low 
proportion of studies aiming at applying a CSCL approach to elementary-school students’ writing may be 
due to the fact that the generally used tools are not appropriate for young writers. In fact, most of the tools 
used in the above-mentioned studies were not particularly designed for elementary-school students’ 
writing activities. To increase the usage of CSCL for young writers, thus, a user-friendly interface should 
be emphasized when developing a computer-assisted writing tool for elementary-school students as 
suggested by Wepner and Ray (2000). Furthermore, although some elementary-school students 
participating in CSCL writing were included in some studies (Hayes & Ge, 2008; Lingnau et al., 2003; 
Yu-Ju Lan, Yao-Ting Sung, Chia-Chun Cheng, and Kuo-En Chang Prewriting by EFL Learners 
 
Language Learning & Technology  139 
Woo et al., 2011), they were not EFL students. Given that prewriting is important for beginning writers 
(e.g., Kroll, 2001), how the CSCL approach could be integrated with the prewriting strategies to enhance 
elementary-school learners’ EFL writing performances is needed to be studied by investigating the effects 
of the combination of CSCL and prewriting strategies on the performance and motivation of young EFL 
writers. 
Based on the results obtained in our pilot study (Lan et al., 2012), the integration of CSCL and prewriting 
strategies has great potential in enhancing the writing performance of elementary-school EFL learners, 
but more efforts are needed to confirm the above-mentioned differences among different prewriting 
strategies. Additionally, the prewriting strategies of interest are as follows: (a) text-based brainstorming 
(BS) which focuses on listing as many words related to the assigned topic as possible, (b) drawing (DR) 
which focuses on using pictures to express the idea for the assigned topic, and (c) mind mapping (MM) 
which focuses on hierarchically labeling nodes and links to express the structure of the assigned topic. 
The purpose of this study, therefore, is to confirm the effects of the integration of CSCL approach and 
different prewriting strategies. The research aims are reached via addressing two research questions: in 
CSCL environment, how do different prewriting strategies affect (a) English writing performance 
(including grammar knowledge and writing quality) and (b) English writing motivation of elementary-
school EFL learners? 
METHODS 
Participants 
This study used convenience sampling to recruit 3 intact classes of fifth-grade students from an 
elementary school in Taipei City, with 27 students in each class. Each class was randomly assigned to one 
of the three prewriting-strategy groups: BS, DR, and MM. The students in the three groups received 
identical instruction in CSCL English writing, except that each group was taught to use different 
prewriting strategies to collect ideas and organize their writing structure at the prewriting stage of the EFL 
writing process.  
When conducting CSCL writing activities, the participants in each class were further divided into 
heterogeneous writing groups based on their English achievement scores in the first semester of the fifth 
grade. Those achieving grade A, grade B or C, and grade D or F were classified as high-, medium-, and 
low-ability learners, respectively. Each group consisted of four students: one high-ability learner and 
three medium- or low-ability learners. Each class comprised seven cooperative writing groups. 
Instruments 
English writing tests 
The writing performance of the participants was assessed using two tests designed by the present authors 
(Lan et al., 2012): the Grammaticality Judgment Test (GJT) (available for downloading from 
http://tell.aclc.ntnu.edu.tw/images/tools/Grammaticality_Judgement_Test.pdf ) and the English 
Composition Test (ECT). The former mainly focused on testing students’ knowledge of English 
grammars taught in their regular EFL classes, especially the 10 target English forms taught in this study. 
On the other hand, the latter aimed at evaluating students’ overall writing quality, including all the 
dimensions listed in the writing rubrics, which will be described later. The two tests were reviewed by 3 
experts in the teaching of EFL writing and administered to 165 fifth graders at the same school in a pilot 
study. Additionally, both the ECT and the GJT were administered to all of the participants before and 
after the treatment as the pre- and posttests. The topic of this written test (ECT) was “A Bad Day,” which 
asked the participants to describe one of their daily life experiences that were relevant to the everyday 
lives of students.

English writing motivation scale 
The English writing motivation scale (EWMS) (available for downloading from 
http://tell.aclc.ntnu.edu.tw/images/tools/English_Writing_Motivation_Scale.pdf ) used in this study for 
measuring the motivation of the participants for writing English compositions was a revised version of the 
writing motivation scale reported by Yeşilyurt (2008). The EWMS was piloted by administering it to 165 
fifth-grade students from the same school (Lan et al., 2012); this produced a reliability coefficient of .93 
for the 29-item scale. 
Teaching materials 
Three teaching packages designed by the authors were used in this study. The structure of the teaching 
materials, which was based on the guidelines given by Gower et al., (1995), focused on the writing 
process rather than simply on final output, and included five steps: introduction, working with ideas, 
planning, drafting, and reviewing/editing. Each package consisted of structured teaching materials and 
detailed instructions to help students produce writing output, such as English riddles and English stories. 
Writing rubrics 
This study adopted the detailed scoring guidelines of Jacob, Zingraf, Wormuth, Hartfiel, and Hughey 
(1981) to assess the qualities of the writing compositions of the learners using five writing rubrics: 
writing content (WC), writing organization (WO), vocabulary and word choice (WV), language use 
(grammar) (WF), and writing mechanics (WM). The complete rubrics are available for downloading from 
http://tell.aclc.ntnu.edu.tw/images/tools/Writing_Rubrics.pdf. 
CSCL writing platform 
Poetry Zone, the CSCL writing platform used in the study, was developed by the authors. It includes six 
modules as shown in Figure 1, aimed at providing L2 learners with explicit grammatical instruction and 
opportunities to produce their written work. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the homepage of the CSCL writing 
platform, a snapshot of the module of the Poem Hunt Team, and the three prewriting strategies taught in 
this study, respectively.  The functions of each module also briefly listed under each module in Figure 1.

Design 
This study adopted a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effects of the three different prewriting 
strategies on the writing performance and motivation of elementary-school EFL learners. The pre- and 
posttest scores of the writing tests and motivation questionnaire were analyzed using a two-way mixed-
design ANCOVA to determine how the participants in the BS, DR, and MM groups differed in terms of 
their writing performance and English writing motivation. The covariate was the English scores of the 
participants obtained in the previous semester. The level of statistical significance was set at α = .05. 
Procedure 
The treatment lasted for 6 weeks, with each class period lasting 40 minutes and was performed twice 
weekly. Figure 4 shows the research procedure of this study. Before the treatment, the participants 
completed the EWMS questionnaire and took both English writing tests to determine their pretreatment 
EFL writing motivation and performance. They were also asked to set up cooperative learning rules for 
their own English writing class. All of the participants then received training on using the CSCL writing 
platform.

Figure 4. Research procedure. 
During the four periods in the two weeks of each teaching package, the participants first received 
instructions on how to write a riddle or a story based on a five-step writing process (in the first two 
periods). The instructions given to the three groups (BS, DR, and MM) were identical, except each group 
was asked to use different prewriting strategies on the CSCL writing platform while collecting ideas and 
making writing plans during the prewriting stage. As shown in Figure 3, while using BS, all group 
members could type, edit and share their ideas with peers at the same time. The DR tool is capable of 
providing the similar functions as the BS, except what students create are pictures rather than texts. The 
MM tool also provides students with a user-friendly environment to cooperate with peers to plan their 
writing via adding idea nodes and typing tags for each node and organizing the relationship among those 
cooperatively created idea nodes. Soon after they finished idea collection, they worked on their own, 
writing their own individual written tasks according to the group discussions, before submitted their 
works to the CSCL writing platform. In the second two periods they started their cooperative writing 
tasks. They had to submit their group written work and conduct peer assessment. Each group presented 
Yu-Ju Lan, Yao-Ting Sung, Chia-Chun Cheng, and Kuo-En Chang Prewriting by EFL Learners 
 
Language Learning & Technology  144 
and shared their riddles or stories with the whole class.  
One week after the 6-week treatment, all the participants again took the English writing tests and 
completed the EWMS questionnaire. During the whole treatment, the procedures, time limits, and the 
contents in the English writing tests, as well as the EWMS questionnaire provided for the three groups 
were the same. 
RESULTS 
The collected data included the scores from the two English writing tests (both the grammar and the 
composition tests, i.e., the GJT and the ECT) and the EWMS (motivation scale). Table 1 lists the results 
of the three tests. All three scores were further analyzed via a two-way mixed-design ANCOVA. The 
independent variables were the group (MM, DR, and BS) and test (pre- and posttests); the dependent 
variables were the scores from the ECT, the GJT, and the EWMS; the covariant was the score of the latest

Table 2 lists the results of the two-way ANCOVA analysis, which shows insignificant effects for group 
and group-by-test interaction. On the other hand, the results of the GJT reached a significant level (F = 
115.89, p < .001) due to the significant improvement made by both the MM and the DR groups, as shown 
in Table 3 of the main-effect analysis results (MM: F = 5.68, p = .021; DR: F = 6.18, p = .016). The 
results indicate that the CSCL prewriting strategies the MM and DR groups both significantly benefited 
EFL writers’ grammar judgement ability, while the CSCL text-based brainstorming strategy did not.

For scoring the ECT pre and posttests, two raters received training on how to score written texts before 
performing the formal ratings. The Pearson product-moment correlation of the scores from the two raters 
was .997. 
A second two-way ANCOVA was run for the ECT results, as listed in Tables 4 and 5. The results listed 
in Table 4 indicated that no significant group or test-by-group effects were found, contrary to the results 
of the ECT (F = 52.70, p = <.001). However, the significant effect was due to the significant 
improvement made only by the MM group as shown in the main-effect analysis results (Table 5, MM: F

Detailed comparison of English composition based on five writing scoring dimensions 
A detailed comparison of individual dimensions of English composition was conducted. Table 6 lists the 
descriptive statistics of the five dimensions of English composition, writing content (WC), writing 
organization (WO), English vocabulary used and word choice in a composition (WV), writing form (WF), 
which is evaluated as EFL writers’ English grammar ability in a composition, and writing mechanics 
(WM). Both the two-way ANCOVA analysis results and the main-effect analysis of the individual 
dimension are listed in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.  
Based on the data listed in Table 7, the two-way ANCOVA analysis results of individual dimensions are 
as follows: the significant effects are identified for Test (pre- and posttest) factors in all the dimensions, 
while both Group (three CSCL prewriting strategies) and test-by-group effects are not. The main-effect 
analysis results (Table 8) indicate that those significant results were due to the significant improvement in 
WV (MM group: F = 6.75, p = .010), WF (MM group: F = 4.64, p = .033), and WM (MM group: F = 
6.57, p = .011; DR group: F = 4.05, p = .016). Regarding WC and WO, although the three CSCL 
prewriting groups all made improvements in posttests, the improvements did not reach significant level.

The results revealed a non-significant test-by-group (F = .56, p = .572) interaction but significant main 
effects for group (F = 3.55, p = .032) and test (F = 12.25, p = .002). Post-hoc tests (the Scheffe test) 
showed (Table 10) that the main-effect of Group (three CSCL prewriting strategies) reached significant 
level (F = 4.89, p = .009) due to the fact that the MM group outperformed the BS group in the posttest 
(Mean Difference = .739, p = .003). In contrast, the main-effect of Test (EWMS pre- and pottest) did not 
reach any significant levels even if the DR group almost did (F = 3.86, p = .055).

DISCUSSION 
Research studies have produced data supporting the effects of computer-supported cooperative writing 
and prewriting-strategy instruction on the English writing performance (e.g., Anderson-Inman & Horney, 
1997; Liu, 2011; Saddler et al., 2004) and motivation (e.g., Hayes & Ge, 2008) of students. However, 
despite the abovementioned positive evidence, few studies investigated the effects of integrating CSCL 
and prewriting strategies on elementary-school EFL learners’ writing performance or motivation. 
Furthermore, regarding the studies on the prewriting strategies, most of the literature mainly focused on 
the effects of explicit/implicit (Holmes, 2003) or with/without (Saddler et al., 2004) prewriting strategy 
instruction on language learners’ writing performance, rather than the differences that might exist in how 
different prewriting strategies may benefit elementary-school EFL writers’ performance and motivation. 
To fill in the gap, the authors based the current study on a pilot study conducted by the present authors 
(Lan et al., 2012). In the current research, the authors have provided empirical validations for the 
significant superiority of CSCL prewriting-strategy instruction over traditional cooperative paper-and-
penciled based instruction. The results were obtained by further investigating the effects of using different 
CSCL prewriting strategies [mind mapping (a hierarchical diagram with text and image), drawing (a 
story-telling picture with images only), and text-based brainstorming (a list of idea or concepts with text 
only)] on elementary-school EFL writers’ learning gains, including grammar knowledge, writing quality, 
and writing motivation. 
Regarding the results of writing tests obtained from this study, although all the students among the three 
different CSCL prewriting strategy groups got higher scores in posttests, only students who used mind 
mapping and students who used drawing during the prewriting stage made significant improvement in 
Yu-Ju Lan, Yao-Ting Sung, Chia-Chun Cheng, and Kuo-En Chang Prewriting by EFL Learners 
 
Language Learning & Technology  149 
GJT. In addition, only the students who used the MM strategy improved significantly in ECT. The further 
investigations into different dimensions of English composition showed that MM strategy benefited 
students more than the other two strategies, especially in vocabulary choices, writing forms, and 
mechanics, although DR also benefited students in the dimension of writing mechanics. The findings 
obtained from the current study confirmed the results of the recent studies on prewriting strategies (e.g., 
Saddler et al., 2004; Whitney et al., 2008):  explicit prewriting strategy instruction improves the writers’ 
performance. Such findings are also consistent with those of Anderson-Inman and Horney (1997) and Lee 
(2013) that a computer-supported MM strategy can enhance students’ writing by promoting visual 
thinking which is a process in which students generate and organize their ideas in preparation for writing 
via drawing a system (structure) of nodes (to represent concepts) and links (to represent the relationship 
between concepts) (Anderson-Inman & Horney, 1997). However, the results conflict with those of Lin, 
Strickland, Ray, and Denner (2004), who found that computer-based MM benefited the writing planning 
and idea collection of native English students but not their writing performance. It should be noted that 
those researchers did not apply cooperative learning in the prewriting and writing process. While 
considering CSCL, the study of Liu (2011) indicated that the quality of the mind maps was higher for 
those constructed cooperatively than for those constructed individually, and was also correlated with the 
writing performance of college students. However, the abovementioned effects of CSCL MM are only 
observed on mid- and low-level EFL college students’ writing performances, while high-level ones 
preferred individually creating their own mind mapping for planning their writing. Whether the results of 
the current study were also affected by the elementary-school students’ levels, as was identified for 
college EFL writers, is an issue which needs further investigation. 
Furthermore, as to the results of English writing motivation test (EWMS), although all three prewriting 
strategy groups expressed more positive motivation at posttest (Table 1), the extent of improvement did 
not reach significant levels. However, in the MM group, the students’ motivation was significantly higher 
than those of the text-based brainstorming group after the treatment (posttest). In brief, CSCL MM 
strategy appears to most benefit elementary-school EFL writers based on the overall results of the three 
tests: GJT, ECT, and EWMS. This result is consistent with the results obtained from the studies 
conducted by Lin et al. (2004): a computer-based MM strategy benefits all elements of writing by 
students; it is also effective at fostering students to write better. 
Although the effects of using the mind mapping strategy on EFL writers’ performance and motivation 
was confirmed, the less effective findings for the text-based brainstorming strategy on elementary-school 
EFL writers’ performance is also worthy of researchers’ attentions because the brainstorming list is a very 
commonly used prewriting strategy in writing classes (e.g. Kroll, 2001; Reid, 1987). Furthermore, based 
on Olson (1992), drawing (DR) is viewed as a very suitable prewriting strategy for young EFL writers 
when they needed to collect and organize their writing ideas in pressure-free situations. However, DR 
strategy did not bring its effects into full play in this study. Those students using the DR strategy for 
planning their composition made significant improvements only in the grammaticality judgement and the 
writing mechanics. In contrast, what Olson (1992) found was that the DR strategy benefited students’ 
vocabulary use, which was not found in the current study.  
Were the above-mentioned results due to the bad fit of the prewriting strategies to some elementary-
school EFL writers’ learning styles? Although all three prewriting strategies in the current study were 
visual-oriented, mostly preferred by the Chinese students, based on Reid’s study (1987), some differences 
exist among the three strategies. The DR strategy includes the main organization of a composition, while 
the text-based brainstorming strategy mainly includes written words/concepts for later composition 
writing. In contrast, the MM strategy includes both written words/concepts and the organization of a 
composition. Thus, although all the three prewriting strategies used in this study were visual-oriented, the 
information possessed by the individual one was different. As suggested by Oxford (2003), when a given 
strategy fits the particular student’s learning style preference, it will be helpful for a given learner. Thus, 
Yu-Ju Lan, Yao-Ting Sung, Chia-Chun Cheng, and Kuo-En Chang Prewriting by EFL Learners 
 
Language Learning & Technology  150 
the different pieces of information acquired by using different prewriting strategies may influence the 
results of the fitness between prewriting strategies and elementary-school EFL writers’ learning styles. 
Furthermore, in addition to the issue of learning style fitness, is it possible that the differences in 
information possession among different prewriting strategies may influence elementary-school EFL 
writers’ cognitive load while doing a composition? According to the arguments given by Chamot (2005), 
beginners struggle with finding the words they need and remembering grammatical conventions in 
writing. Kellogg (2008) also argued that reducing the working memory cost of planning, sentence 
generation, and reviewing process can release the executive attention which is devoted to managing 
article writing, the words/concepts and organization of a composition prepared in the prewriting stage can 
be beneficial to young EFL writers. The answers to the two questions above raised here will be valuable 
to the expansion of the knowledge of instruction in and research on writing strategies.  
In addition to the three possible factors discussed above that affected the effects of different prewriting 
strategies on young EFL writers’ performance and motivation, the process of CSCL prewriting might also 
need to be taken into account. According to the report of Whitney et al. (2008), although prewriting 
instruction was delivered in two classes, the differences identified in the prewriting processes in the two 
classes (one class was student-centered while the other was teacher-centered) had achieved different 
writing outcomes. Even though CSCL were applied in all of the three prewriting strategy groups, the 
cooperation presses might be different among the three groups. Thus, the qualitative information of CSCL 
prewriting behaviors should be also collected and analyzed in the future study to clarify the concerned 
issue. 
CONCLUSION 
The current study has preliminarily confirmed that different CSCL prewriting strategies benefit different 
aspects of the writing performance of young EFL beginning learners as well as their English grammar 
forms and motivation. The findings of this study indicated that (a) the CSCL MM strategy has 
significantly benefited young EFL writers’ grammar knowledge, and learners using this strategy 
outperformed those using the other two strategies in word choice and forms in the English composition 
and writing motivation; (b) the CSCL DR strategy also significantly benefited young EFL writers’ 
grammar knowledge, and improved young EFL writers in writing mechanics; and (c) the CSCL BS 
strategy seems less beneficial to young EFL writers’ performances and motivation. Owing to BS showing 
the smallest learning effect on almost all of the items, it does not seem to be an appropriate strategy for 
elementary-school young EFL writers in Taiwan. However, this is only a temporary argument; further 
investigation should be conducted in future studies. In contrast, the MM and DR strategies are feasible in 
EFL beginning writing classes, and teachers can choose either of them when assisting students according 
to their different learning needs. In other words, EFL teachers can adopt different strategies according to 
different types of instruction or learning goals, and the different learning needs of students, as suggested 
by Chamot (2005), who claimed that tasks should be carefully chosen for providing students with the 
opportunities of practicing strategies. Furthermore, in addition to individual student differences, including 
learning styles and English ability, and prewriting strategies, the CSCL prewriting process should also be 
further investigated in future research.   
In addition to the examination of the prewriting strategies used in different groups, the students in this 
study were all found to have more positive motivation with the application of the CSCL prewriting 
strategies in their English writing courses. Therefore, it is suggested that technology should be 
incorporated as part of writing instruction for young learners so as to promote writing cooperation and 
motivation, as well as increasing interaction, sharing, and feedback among peers, writers, and readers, and 
also between teachers and students. 
However, some limitations of this study should be dealt with in future research. In addition to the issues 
described in the Discussion section which mentions the lack of the foci on EFL ability levels, young EFL 
Yu-Ju Lan, Yao-Ting Sung, Chia-Chun Cheng, and Kuo-En Chang Prewriting by EFL Learners 
 
Language Learning & Technology  151 
learners’ learning styles, and qualitative observation of CSCL process, the fact that this research focuses 
only on English riddles and stories is also a limitation. Although the young EFL writers are familiar with 
the two writing styles, effectively reducing their demands on working memory while writing (Kellogg, 
2008), whether the two prewriting strategies, drawing and text-based brainstorming, benefit other styles 
of writing tasks performed by elementary-school EFL beginning writers needs further investigation. 
Additionally, each of the participating class was randomly assigned a prewriting strategy for the writing 
plan, the differences in the learning styles and their English proficiency levels not considered. Although 
the effects of such individual differences might have been canceled out due to the average performance 
being considered, how different prewriting strategies could be beneficial to the writing performance of 
individual students requires further investigation. 
In summary, the results of the present indicate that different CSCL prewriting strategies exert different 
effects on the English writing performance and motivation of young EFL students. The study findings add 
to the knowledge of research on CSCL prewriting for young EFL learners, thereby complementing the 
previous literature about college students as well as native English speakers. For practical application, it is 
suggested that EFL teachers should consider the different effects of using different strategies on young 
EFL beginning writers from different aspects so as to maximize the learning effects on their students. 
Additionally, the relationship between prewriting strategies and individual differences of young beginning 
writers should receive greater attention from L2 researchers and educators.

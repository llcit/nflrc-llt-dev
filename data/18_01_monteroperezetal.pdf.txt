This study examines how three captioning types (i.e., on-screen text in the same language 
as the video) can assist L2 learners in the incidental acquisition of target vocabulary words 
and in the comprehension of L2 video. A sample of 133 Flemish undergraduate students 
watched three French clips twice. The control group (n = 32) watched the clips without 
captioning; the second group (n = 30) watched fully captioned clips; the third group (n = 
34) watched keyword captioned clips; and the fourth group (n = 37) watched fully 
captioned clips with highlighted keywords. Prior to the learning session, participants 
completed a vocabulary size test. During the learning session, they completed three 
comprehension tests; four vocabulary tests measuring (a) form recognition, (b) meaning 
recognition, (c) meaning recall, and (d) clip association, which assessed whether 
participants associated words with the corresponding clip; and a final questionnaire.  
Our findings reveal that the captioning groups scored equally well on form recognition and 
clip association and significantly outperformed the control group. Only the keyword 
captioning and full captioning with highlighted keywords groups outperformed the control 
group on meaning recognition. Captioning did not affect comprehension nor meaning 
recall. Participants’ vocabulary size correlated significantly with their comprehension 
scores as well as with their vocabulary test scores.

INTRODUCTION 
The emergence of multimedia learning environments (Brett, 1995) and the overall accessibility of video 
(DVD, YouTube, etc.) have created important platforms for enhancing second language (L2) listening 
development (Vandergrift, 2011). These platforms are increasingly being used in classroom practice 
(Grgurović & Hegelheimer, 2007; Vanderplank, 2010) and provide learners with a number of listening 
support options, mostly realized in the form of a “technological overlay” (Robin, 2007, p. 109) such as 
native language (L1) subtitles (L2 video, L1 on-screen text), reversed subtitles (L1 video, L2 text), and 
captioning (L2 video, L2 text). This study focuses on captioning, which maximally exposes learners to 
the L2, and which has been proven to be beneficial for augmenting comprehension (Baltova, 1999; 
Chung, 1999; Markham, 2001) and fostering vocabulary learning (Markham, 1999; Sydorenko, 2010).  
While extensive research has addressed the potential of full captioning for video comprehension and 
vocabulary learning, research studies have not provided answers to several questions. Researchers have 
suggested simplifying full captions (Garza, 1991; Winke, Gass, & Sydorenko, 2010) but research that has

attempted to reduce the textual density by offering only keyword captions has yielded inconclusive results 
(Guillory, 1998; Park, 2004). Additionally, research on vocabulary learning has identified attention as 
being a crucial component for vocabulary learning (Hulstijn, 2001), yet no study has looked at the effects 
of salience in the captioning line for drawing L2 learners’ attention to target vocabulary and enhancing 
incidental vocabulary learning, that is, vocabulary learning as a by-product of listening for meaning 
(Gass, 1999).  
This study expands on previous captioning research by investigating not only video with full captions but 
also video with keyword captions and video with full captions and highlighted keywords in order to 
reveal the effectiveness for L2 learners’ vocabulary learning and comprehension of video content in the 
context of L2 French.  
Literature Review  
Our literature review focuses on three elements: (a) the importance of lexical coverage for successful 
listening comprehension and vocabulary learning, (b) the effectiveness of captions for L2 video 
comprehension, and (c) the effectiveness of captioned video for L2 vocabulary acquisition.  
Research has indicated that comprehension of written or aural input is crucial for acquiring new linguistic 
items incidentally (Gass, 1997; Lee & Van Patten, 2003). Although Rost (2002) identified listening as 
one of the most important sources for L2 acquisition, only a handful of researchers have investigated the 
relationship between listening comprehension and vocabulary learning and tried to discover which factors 
affect comprehension and chances for word learning. In a series of studies, Webb (2010, 2011) and Webb 
and Rodgers (2009) investigated the importance of the lexical coverage of television programs in relation 
to incidental vocabulary learning and text comprehension. They found that knowledge of the 2,000 to 
4,000 most frequent word families provides 95% coverage of television programs, which, according to 
Nation (2006), is the coverage required for incidental learning and adequate text comprehension. Webb 
and Rodgers’ results indicated that to achieve 98% coverage, 5,000 to 9,000 word families are necessary, 
depending on the television genre. van Zeeland and Schmitt (2012) suggested that learners with a 
vocabulary size between 2,000 and 3,000 word families have 95% coverage, which is sufficient for 
adequate understanding of storytelling passages (audio only). Although the findings of the 
aforementioned studies present slightly different figures on the number of words needed, they provide 
accumulative evidence for the claim that vocabulary size is highly correlated with listening success 
(Staehr, 2009) and vocabulary learning (Neuman & Koskinen, 1992). A general finding, however, is that 
most L2 learners have not yet developed a sufficiently large vocabulary to understand L2 video. In spite 
of the richness of video material (Baltova, 1999), it is not necessarily appropriate for adequate 
comprehension and learning (Danan, 2004). One solution to help learners is to provide them with L2 
subtitles or captioning.  
The bulk of captioning research has focused on the effectiveness of captioning for L2 learners’ 
comprehension of video content (Baltova, 1999; Chung, 1999; Garza, 1991; Huang & Eskey, 1999-2000; 
Markham, 2001; Neuman & Koskinen, 1992; Park, 2004; Winke et al., 2010). In general, researchers 
have found that captioning enhances comprehension of L2 clips. Bird and Williams (2002) suggested that 
captions aid speech decoding and segmentation by helping listeners visualize the speech stream and 
clearly indicating word boundaries. Captioning has therefore been characterized as a “mediating device” 
(Vanderplank, 1988, p. 280), helping the learner when automated sound-script recognition falls short. 
Markham (1999) suggested that captions also help the development of word recognition skills. By doing 
so, it makes ambiguous speech clearer the next time it will be encountered (Bird & Williams, 2002; 
Garza, 1991) and enables learners to successfully cope with input that is slightly above their actual 
proficiency level (Danan, 2004; Neuman & Koskinen, 1992).  
While it is generally acknowledged that captioning improves L2 listeners’ understanding (e.g. Baltova, 
1999; Huang & Eskey, 1999-2000), Pujolá (2002) and King (2002) have argued that the presence of 
Maribel Montero Perez, Elke Peters, Geraldine Clarebout, & Piet Desmet Effects of Captioning 
 
Language Learning & Technology 120 
captions makes it difficult to conclude whether comprehension scores reflect participants’ listening or 
reading skills. Although this claim has not been tested empirically, studies have shown that the 
availability of captions does not compromise successful auditory processing (Bird & Williams, 2002; 
Markham, 1999, as cited in Danan, 2004; and Vanderplank, 2010). Other researchers have tried to find 
out if the amount of textual density in the captioning line can be reduced by exploring the potential of 
keyword captioned video (Guillory, 1998; Park, 2004), as suggested by Garza (1991) and more recently 
by Winke et al., (2010). Keywords are expected to tackle the problem of textual density (Guillory, 1998) 
while still providing support. Guillory’s study examined to what extent keywords can support 
understanding of L2 video for beginning learners of French. The results showed that learners in the 
keyword group (receiving only 14% of the full captioning text) performed as well as the full captioning 
group on the comprehension questions. Moreover, the keyword group significantly outperformed the no 
captioning group. Unlike Guillory’s study, Park’s research (2004) indicated that only the more advanced 
students were able to benefit from keyword captions; lower-level students did not significantly 
outperform the no captioning group. It is, however, unclear to what extent this finding can be attributed to 
the keyword captions or to the video input selected for his study. Since Park used the same input for both 
lower-level and higher-level learners, there might have been a mismatch between lower-level learners’ 
proficiency and the level needed for the video (Vanderplank, 2010; Winke, et al., 2010).  
Although far fewer studies have investigated the effects of captioned video on L2 learners’ vocabulary 
learning (e.g. Baltova, 1999; Danan, 1992; Sydorenko, 2010), two general conclusions can be drawn from 
the results of previous research. First of all, it has been shown that captions significantly help learners on 
written form recognition (Neuman & Koskinen, 1992; Sydorenko, 2010) and aural form recognition tests 
(Markham, 1999). However, Sydorenko (2010) found that learners in the video only group outperformed 
the captioning group on an aural form recognition test and therefore concluded that captioning success 
may depend on test modality. Yet, previous research has tended to suggest that captions help L2 learners 
isolate word forms (Winke et al., 2010) and pay attention to them, which may subsequently stimulate 
noticing of these forms. With regard to noticing, it is well documented in the literature on vocabulary 
acquisition that noticing unknown words in the input is the first step in the acquisition process (Huckin & 
Coady, 1999; Hulstijn, 2001). The crucial role of attention is also at the basis of Vanderplank’s  
“speculative model” (1990, p. 228) on language learning through captioned video. In his model, the 
“taking out” of language from captioned video consists of both attention and adaptation. Vanderplank 
defines attention as a conscious selection process that is based on systematically “noting and gathering” 
(p. 229) information and on a reflective component in which learners notice a gap while comparing their 
L2 knowledge with the captioned video input. Adaptation, the selection of linguistic elements that 
learners pay attention to “for [their] own purposes” (Vanderplank, p. 229), aligns with Gass’ position that 
learners have “their own focus of attention” (1999, p. 321). 
Second, captions also help learners make form-meaning connections in the mental lexicon, which 
constitutes a crucial process in the acquisition of lexical items (Van Patten, Williams, & Rott, 2004). With 
regard to those form-meaning connections, studies have found that captions help learners not only to 
recognize the meaning of target words (Huang & Eskey, 1999-2000; Neuman & Koskinen, 1992) but also 
to provide translations (Sydorenko, 2010; Winke et al., 2010) or to produce the target forms themselves 
(Baltova, 1999; Danan, 1992). While these studies provide valuable information on the potential of 
captions for vocabulary acquisition, further research is needed to investigate whether captions can be 
enhanced in order to stimulate vocabulary learning. 
As shown in this section, previous research has lent support to the use of captioning in classroom 
contexts. Yet, it also reveals a number of issues that require further research. One of the recurring 
questions has been whether captions can be enhanced by providing L2 learners with salient keywords 
rather than full captions (Garza, 1991; Guillory, 1998; Park, 2004), or by visually enhancing keywords in 
the captioning line (Winke et al., 2010). While two studies have examined the effectiveness of keywords 
Maribel Montero Perez, Elke Peters, Geraldine Clarebout, & Piet Desmet Effects of Captioning 
 
Language Learning & Technology 121 
for L2 learners’ understanding of video, they produced conflicting results (Guillory, 1998; Park, 2004). 
Moreover, although attention has been identified as a crucial component of vocabulary learning (Hulstijn, 
2001), we are not aware of studies that have focused on the effects of salience in the captioning line, 
either through keywords or highlighted items in full captions, in the context of vocabulary learning. A 
study comparing full captions to (highlighted) keywords may provide more information on (a) what 
learners notice in the input and (b) how full captions and keywords can enhance attention and processing 
quality in terms of vocabulary gains.  
Research Questions 
This study investigates the potential of three types of captioned video, varying in the amount of text and 
the salience of the lexical items in the captioning line, for content comprehension and incidental 
vocabulary learning. In particular, we have included three captioning groups (see Table 1): full captioning 
(FC), keyword captioning (KC), and full captioning with highlighted keywords (FCHK) and compared 
their results with those of a control group (NC).

We were guided by two main research questions:  
1) Does the type of captioning have a differential effect on L2 learners’ understanding of video 
content, as measured by three comprehension tests consisting of global and detailed questions?  
We hypothesize that learners in the captioning groups will outperform the NC group because of the 
availability of on-screen text. With regard to the differences between FCHK, FC, and KC, we adopt a null 
hypothesis as earlier studies have provided no or inconclusive results in this respect. 
2) Does the type of captioning have a differential effect on L2 learners’ incidental learning of 
target vocabulary words, as measured by a form recognition, clip association, meaning 
recognition, and meaning recall test?  
We expect KC and FCHK to outperform FC and NC and for FC to outperform NC on the form 
recognition and clip association tests because the lexical items’ salience may help the groups to notice 
words (Brett, 1998) and associate them with the correct clip more easily. With regard to meaning 
recognition, we hypothesize that FCHK will outperform KC and FC as the availability of highlighted 
keywords and full captioning may facilitate the inference of word meaning and initial form-meaning 
mapping. We also expect the differences between the captioning groups to disappear for meaning recall as 
the latter might be hard to achieve after the relatively short exposure to the target words. Yet, the 
captioning groups are still expected to outperform NC. Table 2 summarizes our hypotheses.

METHODS 
Participants  
The participants were 133 undergraduate law students (55 males, 78 females) at a Flemish university 
(Mage= 17.98 years, SD = .51). All were native speakers of Dutch, except for four French-speaking 
students whose data were excluded from the analysis. All students had an obligatory course in Legal 
French, which focuses on communicative competence and legal vocabulary. Classes were organized in 
six parallel groups of approximately 25 students.  Participants were informed that attending the 
experiment would count as two of the 14 obligatory hours of online training. The participants could be 
considered as (high-) intermediate learners of French, as measured by the self-designed vocabulary size 
test (see Instruments and Results section). 
The four conditions (NC, FC, KC, and FCHK) were randomly assigned to the six groups. Four groups 
were assigned to one of the four conditions, while the other two groups were divided equally over the four 
conditions in order to obtain a balanced composition.  
Materials  
Video Selection 
Since our study was embedded in a formal classroom setting, we selected three relatively short,1 but 
authentic French clips2 from a Belgian and Swiss current affairs program for native speakers of French. 
The clips, which were available online, had a single narrator and included short interviews in which at 
least one interlocutor was shown. The first video (2’25’’, 376 words) discussed the production and export 
strategy of a French brewery. The second and third clip presented the marketing strategy (4’24’’, 772 
words) and history (3’32’’, 576 words) of the Lego © factory. The first and second clip were used without 
modifications. We removed a two-minute section of the third clip because it required too much economic 
knowledge. The three clips were manually transcribed and captions were added with MAGpie  
(http://ncam.wgbh.org/invent_build/web_multimedia/tools-guidelines/magpie).  
Target Word Selection 
An important criterion for selection was that the clips contained a number of words that were very likely 
to be unfamiliar to the participants, that is, the target words (TWs) of this study. We adopted two 
procedures to verify familiarity with the TWs:  
First, we compiled a list of 140 possible TWs appearing in the clips and a set of pseudowords. A 
representative group of students (N = 40) of the same university, with a proficiency level similar to that of 
the actual participants of this study, indicated whether or not they knew each of the 140 words. We 
retained all the words that were not known by at least 70% of the students, which resulted in a set of 20 
TWs (see Appendix A). We did not set the cognition level at 100% because students did not need to 
provide the actual translation and may have overestimated their knowledge.  
Second, prior knowledge of the TWs in the present study was controlled for by means of a pretest. The 
prior knowledge test was administered to the participants four weeks before the learning session and 
Maribel Montero Perez, Elke Peters, Geraldine Clarebout, & Piet Desmet Effects of Captioning 
 
Language Learning & Technology 123 
contained the 20 potential TWs and 18 distracters (easier words). The test format was similar to the 
Vocabulary Knowledge Scale (VKS) (Wesche & Paribakht, 1996) and measured participants’ depth of 
vocabulary knowledge. For each item, participants indicated the corresponding level (see Instruments 
section, Table 4, Test 3). We left out the fifth level (I can use this word in a sentence, write a sentence) 
because it was very unlikely that the learners would be familiar with the TWs. In addition, it is hard to 
determine objectively whether the sentence demonstrates knowledge of the word (Bruton, 2009; Nation & 
Webb, 2011). Results of the prior knowledge test showed that learners were familiar with three TWs, 
which were subsequently excluded from the TWs (see Appendix A).  
Of the 17 retained TWs, there were seven nouns, four verbs, and six multiword units (verb and noun or 
pronoun and verb). None of the TWs were cognates. Since we selected authentic videos, it was not 
possible to control for the frequency of the TWs.3 Four TWs occurred more than once in the clip (see 
Appendix A).  All TWs appeared as highlighted keywords in the FCHK condition and in isolation in the 
KC condition. The four TWs with a higher occurrence were keyword captioned for every occurrence in 
the clip. 
Five experienced lecturers of French were asked to verify the appropriateness of the clips for the target 
audience and to rate the correlation between the audio and visual images in the clips. In their judgment, 
the clips were appropriate and visual images were considered supportive of the dialog but did not provide 
explicit information on the meaning of the TWs. There were, however, contextual clues available in the 
sentences containing the TWs. These clues are important to infer word meaning (Nation, 2001) and 
establish initial form-meaning connections. For example, in the sentence Lego est revenue à la une après 
avoir frôlé le naufrage, il y a dix ans à cause des jeux électroniques  (“Lego made it back to the top, after 
being on the verge of disaster, ten years ago because of electronic games”), the context makes it possible 
to infer the meaning of the underlined TWs.  
Keyword Determination Procedure  
We define keywords as words that are important for the meaning of the sentence or paragraph. The 
keywords were presented like the TWs: either in isolation (KC) or as highlighted words (FCHK). The 
same five experienced lecturers of French were asked to highlight keywords for comprehension in the 
three video transcripts (as in Guillory, 1998, and Park, 2004). We processed their selections, compared 
them with our keywords and selected a final set of keywords, representing 17.11% (or 295 out of 1,724 
words) of the total number of words in the three videos.  
Instruments  
Vocabulary Size Test 
Previous research has revealed that vocabulary size is linked to listening success (Staehr, 2009; van 
Zeeland & Schmitt, 2012; Webb & Rodgers, 2009) and vocabulary learning (Baltova, 1999; Webb & 
Rodgers, 2009). Vocabulary size is also claimed to give a rough estimate of learners’ language 
proficiency (Milton, Wade, & Hopkins, 2010). Therefore, we designed a 50-item4 multiple choice test 
that comprised three parts corresponding to the following word frequency bands: 2,001-4,000 (21 items), 
4,001-5,000 (15 items), and 5,001-7,000 (14 items), based on the Routledge (Lonsdale & Le Bras, 2009), 
Verlinde (Selva, Verlinde, & Binon, 2002), and DPC corpus (Paulussen, Macken, Trushkina, Desmet, & 
Vandeweghe, 2006) frequency lists.  Every test item was a written multiple choice question containing 
four Dutch translation options of the item (see Figure 1). Although a study on aural input should ideally 
include a spoken vocabulary size test, previous studies have shown that the use of a written vocabulary 
size test did not compromise the findings regarding the significant correlation between vocabulary size 
and listening comprehension (e.g., Staehr, 2009; van Zeeland & Schmitt, 2012).

Three Comprehension Tests 
We developed a comprehension test for each clip. Together, the three tests included 41 items: 19 short 
open-ended questions, 14 true-false items, and eight combination items (see Table 3). All participants 
were native speakers of Dutch and were asked to answer the open-ended questions in their L1 (Buck, 
2001). The development of the test items was inspired by Buck’s “competency-based” default listening 
construct (p. 114), which measures general understanding, detailed content, and inferencing ability. Of the 
41 items, 25 items focused on understanding the main ideas and 16 items targeted more detailed yet 
relevant elements. We did not include inferencing questions due to two limitations: (a) we used relatively 
short clips, providing very concrete and factual information; and (b) in order to prevent a task effect on 
vocabulary learning, the comprehension tests did not focus on the sections containing the TWs, posing 
extra limitations on the information that could be included in the tests.  
The comprehension questions targeted the keywords, which means that questions only focused on 
important ideas. Moreover, if we had focused on ideas that were not represented in the keywords, we 
would not have been able to investigate differences between NC and KC (see Table 3).

Four Vocabulary Tests 
It is generally assumed that vocabulary acquisition is not an “all or nothing phenomenon” (Laufer, Elder, 
Hill, & Congdon, 2004, p. 209) but an incremental process with noticing as initial step (Hulstijn, 2001). 
Therefore, we assessed vocabulary learning by means of multiple tests, as suggested by Nation and Webb 
(2011). We first measured three aspects of word knowledge: form recognition, clip association, and 
meaning recall.5 The form recognition test assessed whether learners were able to recognize the TWs, a 
selection of keywords that were not TWs, and some distracters.  Learners ticked off “yes” if they thought 
the word appeared in the clips, and “no” if they did not (see Table 4, Test 1). This test did not include 
non-words but we controlled for guessing by also presenting a clip association test. The clip association 
test contained the same TWs, keywords, and distracters as the form recognition test and built on learners’ 
answers on the previous test. If learners had checked “yes” on the form recognition test, they were asked 
to indicate in which clip the word had occurred (Brewery or Lego). This allowed us to check if they could 
associate the word with a vague meaning (see Table 4, Test 2). The form recognition and clip association 
tests were combined with a VKS identical to the one used in the prior knowledge test (see Table 4, Test 
3). The VKS enabled us to check whether learners were able to translate the TWs into their L1 (meaning 
recall).

  1. evenwicht (balance) 
  2. ontgoocheling (disappointment) 
  3. bitterheid (bitterness) 
  4. deskundigheid (expertise) 
In addition to the first test, we also administered a multiple choice meaning recognition test that included 
only the 17 TWs in order to check if learners were able to recognize the translation of the TWs among 
four Dutch translation options (see Table 4, Test 4). The tests in Table 4 were all administered 
immediately after the treatment.6  
Questionnaire 
Participants completed a questionnaire, consisting of a five-point Likert scale, including statements on 
video comprehension (research question 1), vocabulary learning (research question 2), and the usefulness 
of captions for both tasks. The questionnaire data were used to help us clarify the findings of our 
quantitative research.  
Procedure 
Three months before the experiment, the materials and procedures were pilot tested with a group of 22 
students in their last year of secondary school who were enrolled in a French summer course. The 
participants completed all the tests used in the present study and evaluated the materials by means of a 
questionnaire. Our main finding was that the comprehension tests were too easy because many 
participants achieved maximum scores. However, the questionnaire results showed that they considered 
the clips challenging. As a result, some questions were rewritten for the present study and extra open-
ended questions were added. The results of the pilot test did not reveal problems with the vocabulary tests 
or the TWs.  
One month prior to the learning session, participants in the present study completed a vocabulary size and 
prior knowledge test (see Figure 2). They were told that such tests are typically administered at the 
beginning of the academic year. However, they were not informed about the aim of the experiment.

The learning session took place in three computer rooms with a PC and headset for each participant. 
Students were told that the exercises were part of a research study on the use of video in the L2 
classroom. We explained that they were going to watch three short clips. Learners completed a

comprehension test after viewing each clip twice (see Figure 2). Students were prompted to focus on the 
meaning of the clips and were forewarned of the comprehension tests. Participants were informed that 
each comprehension test contained short, open-ended questions, true-false questions, and combination 
tasks. They were not allowed to make notes, either during the clips or in between viewings. In order to be 
able to gauge incidental learning, we did not inform participants about the vocabulary tests, as suggested 
by Hulstijn (2001), who states that the incidental character is ensured at the level of test announcement. 
At the end of the learning session, all participants were debriefed about the aim of the experiment 
We tested all the students in two consecutive sessions of 90 minutes. The supervisors made sure that 
participants involved in the first session did not see participants of the second session and could thus not 
inform them about the procedures, as this might have compromised the incidental nature of the 
vocabulary acquisition this experiment aimed to measure. All the tests were pencil-and-paper tests.  
Scoring 
Comprehension Tests 
Full credit (1 point) was given for exact answers. Partial credit (0.5) was given for partially correct 
answers to open-ended questions. For example, partial credit was given when learners provided only one 
of the two parts of the answer to the question Explain why Lego is a classic marketing example.  
[Lego has an online platform where customers present their creations.]/[The customers provide 
inspiration for new Lego sets.] 
Each true-false item consisted of two tasks -  (a) indicate whether the sentence is true or false and (b) if 
false, correct the sentence - and had a maximum score of 2 points.  
Vocabulary Tests 
One point was given for each correct answer on the form recognition, clip association, and meaning 
recognition tests. The VKS could have been scored in two ways (Bruton, 2009, p. 294): we could have 
either used the level number or recoded answers into known words (i.e., correctly translated words, 1 
point) and unknown words (0 points).  Because we used the VKS to measure meaning recall rather than 
progress in the scale (Nation & Webb, 2011), we chose to recode into binomial scoring (see Table 5).7 
Table 5. Scoring of VKS

Although most TWs were unknown to students, we wanted to account for their minimal prior knowledge. 
We did so by calculating retention scores (Horst, Cobb & Meara, 1998; Peters, 2006, p. 77) for the 
meaning recognition and meaning recall test (see Equation 1):  
(1)  
 
As shown by the equation, we calculated the difference between the number of correct responses on the 
Maribel Montero Perez, Elke Peters, Geraldine Clarebout, & Piet Desmet Effects of Captioning 
 
Language Learning & Technology 128 
test (meaning recognition and meaning recall) and the number of known words, as measured by the prior 
knowledge test, and then divided this number by the total number of TWs (max test) minus the prior 
knowledge score. Since known words were dismissed from the analysis, the result is a retention score 
representing the percentage of the actual learning gains.  
Analyses 
We conducted a multivariate analysis of covariance (Tacq, 1997) for each of the two research questions. 
The independent variable was type of captioning (NC, KC, FC, and FCHK); the covariate was the score 
on the vocabulary size test. There were two sets of dependent variables: the comprehension tests (research 
question 1) and the vocabulary tests (research question 2). We set the significance level of the p-value at 
.05 in all statistical analyses.  
As an effect size measure, we used partial eta squared (ηp²), which refers to the proportion of total 
variance explained by an effect “in which the effects of other independent variables and interactions are 
partialled out” (Richardson, 2011, p. 135). Effect size values have the advantage of being independent of 
sample size. We used Cohen’s rules of thumb (1988) for interpretation: small, ηp² > .0099, medium, ηp² > 
.0588,  and large, ηp² > .1379. 
RESULTS 
Vocabulary Size Test 
Table 6 summarizes the test scores for each of the three frequency bands and shows that participants were 
most proficient on the first part, which assessed knowledge of the 2,001 to 4,000 most frequent words. 
Scores decreased as the word frequency level increased (see Table 6). Since vocabulary size is an 
estimate of language proficiency, scores indicate that participants’ proficiency level in the current study 
ranged from intermediate to high intermediate. This is also the required level at the end of high school 
education according to the criteria of the Common European Framework of Reference (Council of 
Europe, 2011). A one-way ANOVA revealed that the participants in the four conditions did not differ 
significantly in terms of vocabulary size, F(3, 129) = 0.01, p = .998, ηp² < .01. The 50-item size test had 
an acceptable reliability index (N = 133, Cronbach’s alpha = .78) and was used as a covariate in further 
analyses in order to control for learner variables.

Research Question 1 
We checked the correlations between the three comprehension tests and found that the scores of 
comprehension test 1 correlated significantly with test 2 (r = .39, p < .001) and test 3 (r = .30, p = .001); 
test 2 correlated significantly with test 3 (r = . 35, p < .001). In order to take into account the relationship 
between the dependent variables, we performed a MANCOVA (Tacq, 1997). 
Table 7 summarizes mean scores on the comprehension tests. The results of the MANCOVA contradicted

our initial hypotheses and showed type of captioning had no significant effect of on comprehension 
scores, Wilks’s lambda, F(9, 301.93) = 0.40, p = .935, ηp² = .01.

Note. The maximum scores of comprehension tests 1, 2, and 3, were 16, 7, and 18, respectively.  
The covariate vocabulary size was significantly related to the comprehension scores, Wilks’s lambda, 
F(3, 124) = 8.81, p < .001, and had a large effect: ηp² = .18. The positive b-values for each comprehension 
test (see Table 8), indicated a positive relationship between vocabulary size and comprehension: the 
larger one’s vocabulary, the better the comprehension score.

We found the highest mean scores on the form recognition test (see Table 10). The retention scores were

Note. The smaller number of participants on the vocabulary tests is due to the fact that some participants accidentally skipped 
one or two pages due to double-sided printing of the test, which consisted of 9 pages. The maximum score on the form 
recognition and clip association test was 17. 
The analysis of the between-subjects effects (see Table 11) showed that type of captioning significantly 
affected the first three components of vocabulary knowledge tested, that is, form recognition, clip 
association, and meaning recognition. Vocabulary size scores were significantly related to all four 
vocabulary components, and b-values reported in Table 11 indicate a positive relationship: the larger 
one’s vocabulary, the more vocabulary gains.

The results of the post hoc analysis (Bonferroni correction) partially confirmed our hypotheses: captioned 
groups significantly outperformed the control group on form recognition and clip association. However, 
no differences between the captioning groups were found. For meaning recognition, only KC and FCHK 
significantly outperformed NC. No significant differences between KC, FCHK, and FC were found.  
Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no differences between the captioned groups and the control group

on the meaning recall test.  
The effect sizes showed a decreasing effect of type of captioning (FC, KC, FHCK, or NC) as the 
vocabulary component tested increased in difficulty. The effect size of type of captioning was largest for 
form recognition (ηp² = .27) and clip association (ηp² = .16) and smaller for meaning recognition (ηp² = 
.11). The opposite pattern was found for the covariate (vocabulary size): the deeper the knowledge 
component tested, the larger the effect size of the covariate (see Table 11).

With regard to the results of the vocabulary statements, we observed that all groups considered the textual 
context and images helpful for word meaning inferences. Moreover, participants would have focused 
more on the words if they had been forewarned of a vocabulary test. Learners in the NC group were most 
confident about not needing extra support, but would activate captions if available.  
When asked about the usefulness of captions, the FC and FCHK groups considered captioning more 
useful than the KC group. The latter also provided the highest, yet still average, mean score for the 
distraction induced by the support. The captioning groups were equally positive about the usefulness of 
captions for recognizing and learning new words.  
DISCUSSION 
This study was motivated by the need to explore variations on captioning, either by providing the learner 
with more salience and/or less textual density. The results suggest that (a) the type of captioning did not 
affect comprehension scores; (b) learners’ vocabulary size positively correlated with comprehension and 
incidental vocabulary learning; (c) the presence of on-screen text supported receptive vocabulary 
learning; and (d) salience induced by KC or FCHK did not result in greater vocabulary gains than 
captioning without salience (FC).  
Research Question 1 
The analyses revealed that participants in all conditions achieved similar scores on the comprehension 
tests, which is at variance with our hypothesis. Thus, our findings only provide limited support for the use 
of captions and keyword captions and therefore contradict previous research (e.g. Baltova, 1999; Chung, 
1999; Markham, 2001). An important explanation for the similar test scores might lie in the information 
targeted by the comprehension questions. First of all, the comprehension questions did not focus on the 
TWs, in order to prevent an effect of the comprehension tests on vocabulary retention. Because learners 
did not need the TWs to answer to the comprehension questions, the differences between the four 
conditions might have been minimized. Perhaps the parts containing the TWs did cause problems for the 
NC group, but this was not reflected in the comprehension test scores as the questions did not require the 
TWs occurring in the captions. Second, because of the nature of the clips, which presented concrete 
factual information, we could only ask literal comprehension questions, rather than a combination of 
literal and inferencing questions (Buck, 2001). Third, it is possible that captioning groups decoded the 
Maribel Montero Perez, Elke Peters, Geraldine Clarebout, & Piet Desmet Effects of Captioning 
 
Language Learning & Technology 133 
clips better than the NC group (Bird & Williams, 2002), a hypothesis that is supported by the higher 
scores of the FC, KC, and FCHK groups on the form recognition test (cf. research question 2). Yet, our 
findings suggest that a better decoding does not necessarily result in a better understanding of the 
message.  
It could be hypothesized that the clips were too easy for the participants and therefore minimized the 
comprehension differences between the groups. Yet, what needs to be stressed is that the groups achieved 
only intermediate scores on the comprehension tests, which shows that content understanding was 
challenging for the participants. Although the usefulness of captions was not reflected in higher 
comprehension scores, questionnaire results indicated that participants in the FC and FCHK groups 
considered captions useful for understanding the clips (see Table 12, question 10). While the NC group 
indicated that they did not need extra support to understand the videos, they unambiguously indicated that 
they would use full captions if they had been available (see Table 12, question 9).  
With respect to the keyword captions, we found that salience of the keywords for the KC and FCHK 
groups did not help learners to outperform FC and NC on the comprehension test. Our results are in line 
with Park’s findings for lower intermediate and intermediate learners (2004) and therefore contradict 
research on reading comprehension in which it has been demonstrated that salience and attention 
allocation are important for successful text comprehension (Gaddy, van den Broeck, Sung, 2001). 
Moreover, learners in the KC group reported lower mean scores on the usefulness of keyword captions 
when compared to the FC and FCHK group (see Table 12, question 10). In order to reveal the potential of 
keyword captioning, further research is necessary.    
Finally, learners’ scores on the vocabulary size test were significantly related to their comprehension 
scores, and had a large effect size. Our result provides additional evidence in support of previous research 
on this relationship (e.g., Staehr, 2009; van Zeeland & Schmitt, 2012). 
Research Question 2 
Form Recognition and Clip Association 
The results of our analyses partially confirm our hypothesis and reveal that the captioning groups (FC, 
KC, and FCHK) significantly outperformed the control group on the form recognition test. Although 
mean scores were generally lower for clip association, we found a similar pattern. Overall, our results 
confirm the usefulness of captions at the decoding level and their capacity to help learners to isolate 
words (Winke et al., 2010) and pay sufficient attention to these items. Our results are consistent with 
Vanderplank’s model (1990), in which the role of subtitles was considered crucial to taking out words 
from captioned input. This ties in with previous research that has found positive effects of captions for 
enhancing written form recognition (e.g. Neuman & Koskinen, 1992; Sydorenko, 2010).  On the other 
hand, we did not find evidence for the hypothesis that the salient KC and FCHK groups would 
outperform the FC group on the form recognition and clip association test. Interestingly, the availability 
of on-screen text, rather than salient input, had an overall positive effect on form recognition and clip 
association. This finding was confirmed by our questionnaire results (see Table 12, questions 12 and 13) 
which showed that the FC, KC, and FCHK groups found the availability of captioning equally useful for 
recognition and word learning.  
How can we explain that salience did not enhance noticing? In his model, Vanderplank (1990) claimed 
that the “taking out” of language consists of a combination of attention and adaptation. More particularly, 
he stated that learners might pay attention to words and select “language attended to for own purposes” 
(p. 229). Although keywords were not made salient for the FC group, learners might have noticed these 
words for different reasons.  
One possibility is that unfamiliarity with the TWs drew learners’ attention and produced a “conscious 
focus on form” which occurs “particularly when new or striking expressions are used” (Vanderplank, 
Maribel Montero Perez, Elke Peters, Geraldine Clarebout, & Piet Desmet Effects of Captioning 
 
Language Learning & Technology 134 
1988, p. 276). By comparing the language used in the captioned video with their own lexis, learners might 
have noticed gaps in their knowledge (Gass, 1997).  
Another reason may be found at the level of test announcement, that is, the comprehension test might 
have directed the learners’ attention towards particular words even though they were not textually salient. 
Hulstijn (2001, p. 268) suggested that, on the one hand, learners can “serve under an intentional 
condition” when trying to understand the text with the subsequent comprehension test in mind. On the 
other hand, they may “serve under an incidental condition in that they are being exposed to unfamiliar 
words” and are not aware that a vocabulary test will follow (p.268). Because learners were prompted to 
focus on the meaning of the clips and were only forewarned of the comprehension test, learners in the FC 
group might have recognized words as well as the salient groups because they considered them important 
for the test and the meaning of the clips. This explanation seems plausible since the majority of the TWs 
were considered keywords for comprehension by our experienced lecturers. Moreover, this finding 
confirms the claim that learners can simultaneously attend to form and meaning when the form is 
important for the meaning (Baltova, 1999; Van Patten, 1990).  
Meaning Recognition and Recall 
In order to determine the quality of processing, we included a meaning recognition and recall test. 
Although we hypothesized that participants in the FCHK group would outperform participants in the 
other conditions on the meaning recognition test, the group scored only slightly, but not significantly, 
higher than the KC and FC groups. The results of the meaning recognition test differed from the previous 
two vocabulary tests in that KC and FCHK significantly outscored only the NC group and therefore seem 
to have processed the TWs more elaborately than the NC group. The FC group did not differ significantly 
from the NC group. This finding might be explained by the fact that the TWs were better isolated for the 
salient keyword groups. Prince (1996, p. 489) underlined the importance of “isolating the word from the 
context, so that context provides the means to identify the meaning of the new word.”  Yet, since the 
salient keyword groups did not significantly outperform the FC group, this result should be interpreted 
cautiously.  
In order to find out how captioning might have helped word meaning inferences, learners were asked 
about the usefulness of contextual and visual clues. Results revealed that learners in all conditions 
considered the textual context most helpful and reported very similar scores (see Table 12, questions 5 
and 6). A similar appreciation was found for the support of visual clues, although scores were slightly 
lower. Given the rather abstract nature of most TWs, the audio-video correlation could indeed only 
provide scarce visual clues.  
Generally speaking, we found that participants made initial form-meaning connections for a series of 
TWs. But which conditions fostered the most qualitative vocabulary processing? The results of the 
meaning recall test were low and, contrary to our hypothesis, no differences were found between the 
groups. These findings do not support previous research (e.g. Danan, 1992; Sydorenko, 2010; Winke et 
al., 2010), which showed beneficial effects of captioning on meaning recall. Our study differs, however, 
from the cited articles in that they focused on low intermediate and beginning students respectively.  
Plausible explanations for the low gains might be the following: (a) Since captioning as such does not 
provide concrete information on word meaning, learners are required to construct meaning based on 
inferring processes. Yet, the meaning of difficult words may remain unknown even after two or more 
viewings. (b) Because of the “real-time nature” (Buck, 2001, p. 6) of listening, learners are left with very 
little time to infer word meaning from context, which might prevent them from hearing the rest of the 
video (Goh, 2000). (c) It has been shown that inferring word meaning is a difficult, slow, and often an 
unsuccessful process (Liu & Nation, 1985). Because we wanted to make sure that words were unfamiliar, 
we were forced to focus on low frequency words, which might have a higher “learning burden” (Laufer, 
2005, p. 234). Thus, the meaning recall test was a very demanding test because participants were expected

Language Learning & Technology 135 
to watch the clips, read the captions, remember the content, derive the meaning of unknown words 
successfully, and finally remember the meaning of a set of TWs after only two viewings of the clips. 
Vocabulary Size 
Our study corroborated the findings of previous research on the importance of vocabulary size for 
successful vocabulary learning (Webb, 2010; Webb & Rodgers, 2009). We found medium and significant 
effect sizes of vocabulary size for form recognition and clip association. The larger one’s vocabulary size, 
the less decoding load a video presents and the more time learners can spend on specific lexical items 
(Goh, 2000; Pulido, 2007). Yet, the effect sizes for vocabulary size were considerably lower than the 
effect size for type of captioning, which suggests that captioning is crucial to form recognition and clip 
association.  
For meaning recognition and recall, we found very large effect sizes for vocabulary size; these effects 
were considerably higher than the effect sizes for type of captioning. Indeed, it is well documented that 
greater lexical knowledge seems to facilitate guessing from context (Liu & Nation, 1985) and it has been 
characterized as “a critical factor” (Nation, 2001, p. 233) for successfully inferring word meaning.  
Pedagogical Implications 
When teachers intend to use video for stimulating vocabulary acquisition, they should be encouraged to 
use captioning because it might facilitate students’ recognition of unknown words and their making initial 
form-meaning connections. Our results provide limited support for the use of on-screen text for 
improving content comprehension. We therefore recommend that teachers adopt a “staged video 
approach” (Danan, 1992) in which they gradually decrease the amount of text. Teachers could show the 
same video first with FCHK or FC, then with KC and finally in a NC mode. By doing so, they might help 
learners to progressively decrease the amount of support while at the same time optimizing word 
recognition and chances for word learning.  
Teachers should also be encouraged to address the importance of vocabulary size as it has a positive 
effect not only on successful comprehension but also on vocabulary learning. Teachers could provide 
opportunities for learners to enlarge their vocabulary size through exposure to captioned video or by 
means of other incidental (e.g., extensive multimedia reading) or intentional (explicit vocabulary 
learning) tasks.  
CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS  
Although this study has tried to respond to the need to explore variations on standard captioning, it also 
presents a number of limitations. First of all, we could not assess understanding of the complete clips 
because our comprehension tests had to focus on the parts that did not contain the TWs. Moreover, the 
clips were short, which presents limitations in terms of the type of information targeted by the questions. 
Our results therefore provide only limited insight into how different types of captioning can improve 
comprehension. Second, this study has focused on a set of predefined TWs. Yet, learners might have 
noticed and established form-meaning connections of other words in the videos they were not familiar 
with. Because our vocabulary tests only included predefined TWs, we are unaware of any other learning 
gains (Pulido, 2007). Third, we assessed noticing using an indirect measure (i.e., the form recognition 
test). More accurate data on what exactly induced form recognition, taking into account potentially 
moderating variables such as frequency of occurrence and the part of speech of the TWs (Webb, 2007), 
might reveal when and why learners notice certain items. Finally, the written format of the vocabulary 
posttests may have favored the captioning groups to some extent. Unlike the control group, they also 
encountered the target words in their written form.  
As a conclusion to this paper, we would like to indicate three future research directions. First of all, future 
studies might investigate the extent to which captioning, and keyword captioning in particular, can be

Language Learning & Technology 136 
enhanced by adding access to the target words’ meaning, such as a gloss containing the L1 translation 
(Sydorenko, 2010; Webb, 2010). Research questions could focus on the use of such glosses and their 
effectiveness for comprehension and vocabulary learning. Second, current research on captioning has 
almost exclusively measured the value of short clips, by means of isolated experiments. As one reviewer 
suggested, it may be interesting to look at the potential of captioning when used with full-length TV 
programs (Rodgers & Webb, 2011). We should also encourage longitudinal research in order to 
investigate whether systematic and long-term exposure to captioned video affects learners’ use of 
captions and the effectiveness of these captions in terms of improved listening comprehension. Third, the 
availability of on-line measures such as eye-tracking might shed more light on the time learners spend on 
the captioning line (Winke, Gass, & Sydorenko, 2013) and provide an objectified measure to study the 
role of attention in vocabulary learning (Godfroid, Housen, & Boers, 2010). Further research on the topics 
mentioned above will undoubtedly allow us to gain a greater insight into how and when captioning can 
help language learning.

NOTES 
1. Because a formal learning context differs from normal viewing situations, a number of practical 
limitations such as time constraints inevitably played a role in the selection of clips. In Flemish high 
schools for example, one learning session lasts only between 50 and 60 minutes, which would make it 
difficult to use long clips and exploit them in a meaningful way. In this context, short clips present 
ecologically valid L2 viewing and practicing opportunities. The length of the clips in this study was also 
similar to the clips used in previous studies on captioning effects (e.g. Park, 2004; Sydorenko, 2010; 
Winke et al., 2010).  
2. “Video” and “clip” are used interchangeably.  
3. The differences in occurrences of the TWs may be considered a limitation of the clips used. Although 
frequency of the TWs may have played a role for vocabulary learning in this study, as suggested by 
previous research (Webb, 2007), results show that learners were able to recognize more than the four 
TWs with higher occurrence (see Table 10). Nonetheless, results do not imply that they necessarily 
noticed the four TWs with higher occurrence correctly. A detailed analysis of the aspects that induced 
form recognition and vocabulary learning might clarify this aspect but was beyond the scope of the 
present study. 
4. The initial vocabulary size test consisted of 53 items. As the reliability test indicated that three items 
correlated negatively, these items were left out of the analysis. 
5. The concepts of meaning recognition and meaning recall are not clearly defined. We adopt the 
distinction made by Laufer et al. (2004) between active and passive recognition and recall, whereby 
passive recognition consists in “choosing the meaning of the target word from the four options provided” 
(p. 207) and passive recall consists in translating the target form. 
6. This study did not include delayed post-testing. Hulstijn (2003) argued that a study measuring the 
effectiveness “during a learning session in which words are presented for the first time, requires only an 
immediate posttest” (p. 372) because it is difficult to ascertain whether learners’ scores on the delayed 
posttest should be ascribed to the experimental treatment or to other learning opportunities which 
occurred in the period between the learning session and the delayed test (Hulstijn, 2003; Nation & Webb, 
2011). Nation and Webb pointed out that this problem could be avoided by using nonsense words instead 
of real TWs. Yet, the use of nonsense words in a study based on authentic video seems inconvenient as it 
would considerably affect the original speech stream.  
7. We used the VKS to measure meaning recall rather than the progress made. Using the VKS as 
described in Nation and Webb (2011) might have offered more precise data concerning learners’ 
progress.

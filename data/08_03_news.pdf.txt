NFLRC Publications
Filmed on location in East Java, Indonesia, the Mari Belajar Sopan Santun Bahasa Indonesia set
consists of two videotapes, a manual, and extended notes on the individual video scenarios. The videos
present interactions among Indonesian native speakers and language learners as they engage in tasks and
activities of everyday life. The videos model for foreign language learners how to speak politely in
Indonesian by drawing their attention to the ways language is used and the ways it varies according to the
social context in which the interaction occurs. The manual includes the pedadogical background of this
project, sample lessons, learning focus, suggested activities, and bibliographies on Indonesian pragmatics
and on the teaching of pragmatics in foreign language classrooms. A docuent contatining extended notes
on the videotaped scenarios is available at no charge online.

ATELL is pleased to announce the availability of the CALL Catalogue: http://www.callcatalogue.com.au/
The CALL Catalogue has been designed as a resource for researchers, designers, and teachers interested
in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). It is essentially a searchable bibliographic database. It
consists of a large set of abstracted articles on CALL and an index of specially designed keywords. The
CALL Catalogue is an ongoing research venture that began with the construction of a large corpus of
CALL publications for 1999. As such the CALL Catalogue (1999) included all the chapters in four books
(Cameron, 1999a, 1999b; Debski & Levy, 1999; Egbert & Hanson-Smith, 1999) and all the articles in
four major CALL journals: Computer Assisted Language Learning, CALICO, ReCALL, and the online
journal, Language Learning and Technology. This amounted to 177 journal articles and book chapters for
the year. Each item was then abstracted and indexed to form the original CALL Catalogue (1999). So far
the CALL Catalogue has been completed for 1999 and 2000.
The CALL Catalogue is an ongoing project and we are keen to have your contributions (see Abstracting
& Indexing Guidelines on the Web site). Our immediate goal is to add abstracted and indexed articles on
CALL for 2001, and then, subsequently, to work forward to the year prior to the current year of
publication. The CALL Catalogue directly relates to published works by Levy (2000, 2002) where more
detail about the overarching framework and methods of production are given.
The CALL Catalogue is the first resource to be made available by ATELL, the Australasian Technology
Enhanced Language Learning network. ATELL is an informal grouping of CALL researchers and
practitioners in Australia and New Zealand. More resources for researchers and practitioners are to
follow.

Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition,
University of Minnesota (CARLA)
CARLA is one of several National Language Resource Centers whose role is to improve the nation's
capacity to teach and learn foreign languages effectively. Launched in 1993 with funding from the
national Title VI Language Resource Center program of the U.S. Department of Education, CARLA's
mission is to study multilingualism and multiculturalism, develop knowledge of second language
acquisition, and advance the quality of second language teaching, learning, and assessment by conducting
research and action projects sharing research-based and other forms of knowledge across disciplines and
education systems extending, exchanging, and applying this knowledge in the wider society.
CARLA's research and action initiatives include a focus on the articulation of language instruction,
content-based language teaching through technology, culture and language studies, less commonly taught
languages, language immersion education, second language assessment, second language learning
strategies, research on pragmatics and speech acts, support for study abroad, and technology and second
language learning.
To share its latest research and program opportunities with language teachers around the country,
CARLA offers the following resources: an internationally acclaimed summer institute program for
teachers; a database which lists where less commonly taught languages are taught throughout the country;
listservs for teachers of less commonly taught languages and immersion educators; a working paper
series; conferences and workshops; and a battery of instruments in French, German, and Spanish for
assessing learners' proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening at two levels on the ACTFL
scale. Check out these and other CARLA resources on the CARLA Web site at

News from the National Center for ESL Literacy Education
• NCLE's new Brief Issues in Improving Immigrant Workers' English Language Skills identifies
five issues to be addressed in workplace education and offers suggestions for addressing these
issues.
• Another new Brief, Second Language Acquisition in Adults: From Research to Practice discusses
what the research says about learner motivation, interaction, and vocabulary development and
how it applies to adults learning English.
• Two new online resource collections are available. First, Second Language Acquisition provides
background information about Second Language Acquisition (SLA) -- the study of how people
learn to communicate in a language other than their native language. The collection highlights
NCLE and ERIC resources as well as pertinent organizations, periodicals, and policy issues. Of
particular interest is the annotated bibliography of SLA research on learner motivation,
interaction, and vocabulary development.
The second collection combines the advice of experienced teachers with information about online
and print resources. What Beginning Teachers and Tutors of Adult English Language Learners
Need to Know provides a useful overview for those new to adult English as a second language
(ESL) teaching. The collection features comments from a focus group of experienced teachers
held at the Arlington Education and Employment Program (REEP) in Arlington, Virginia, a short
list of useful books for teachers as well as an annotated short list of curricula.
The current edition of NCLE's newsletter, NCLEnotes, features an article about NCLE’s work with Senior
Service America (SSA) to develop a guidebook for practitioners and programs working with linguistically
and culturally diverse seniors. Other NCLEnotes features include resource updates, descriptions of new
NCLE publications, and the The Book Shelf where Miriam Burt reviews Paper Fish by Tina De Rosa.

Call for Papers for Special Issue of LLT 
 
Theme: Game and Play Activity in Technology-Mediated L2 Teaching and 
Learning 
 
Special Issue Editors: Jonathon Reinhardt & Julie Sykes 
 
This special issue of Language Learning & Technology will focus on the research and practice of game 
and play activity in technology-mediated second/foreign language teaching and learning (L2TL) 
environments. The globalization of the digital gaming industry, the diversification of games into new and 
culturally hybrid genres, a global increase in access to broadband, and increasing numbers of non-
traditional game players, have precipitated a notable expansion of digital game and play activity into new 
contexts and applications. Game and play dynamics are being increasingly applied in domains 
traditionally not associated with games, like art, music, literature, science, commerce, and education. 
Designers and players are finding new modalities like location-based games (e.g. geocaching, urban 
gaming, and flash mobs), and integrating a variety of technologies into new games like online, video, 
tablet, mobile, and social networking applications. In other words, digital gaming is no longer only 
computer and video gaming, but playful, rule-bound, cooperative or competitive, chance-filled, imitative, 
and/or immersive activity, that is in some way technology-mediated. 
 
These developments warrant consideration by L2TL practitioners and researchers for the potentials that 
digital game and play activity hold to inform technology-enhanced L2TL. This issue responds by bringing 
together empirical research that uses a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches from applied 
linguistics, game studies, educational gaming, sociology, communication studies, and other related fields, 
and by supporting a broad interpretation of the notions of digital game and play activity. 
 
All submissions should present either systematic empirical findings on language learning outcomes or 
processes or an original conceptual framework that systematically integrates theory, practice, and 
research. 
Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 
Adaptation of vernacular, off-the-shelf digital games 
Analysis of game-mediated discourse, including game-embedded, game-emergent, and game-
attendant discourses  
Comparisons of particular game genres, types, platforms, or player configurations  
Design and use of game-based and simulated immersion environments (i.e., game applications 
designed specifically for L2 learning) 
Game and play activity and L2 learner identity  
Game and play activity in distance, blended, or telecollaborative environments 
Game and play activity in virtual worlds, simulations, or social networking

5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION & 
CONSERVATION (ICLDC) 
 
The 5th International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation (ICLDC), “Vital Voices: 
Linking Language & Wellbeing,” will be held March 2–5, 2017, at the Hawaiʻ i Imin International 
Conference Center on the campus of the University of Hawaiʻ i at Mānoa. The 5th ICLDC is hosted by the 
Department of Linguistics and the National Foreign Language Resource Center at the University of 
Hawaiʻ i at Mānoa. 
The conference program will feature two keynote talks, Talk Story Roundtable Discussions, and 
Workshops. An optional Hilo Field Study (on the Big Island of Hawaiʻ i) to visit Hawaiian language 
revitalization programs in action will immediately precede the conference (February 28–March 1). 
Wellbeing is a state of the body and mind that encompasses the presence of positive moods and emotions, 
life satisfaction, fulfillment, and positive functioning and the absence of negative emotions like anxiety. 
Public health experts, policymakers, and economists are coming to recognize the implications of 
wellbeing for society as a whole, as well as individuals, thanks to a growing set of results from cross-
sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies. 
Increasingly, researchers in several fields have noted a positive correlation between language 
maintenance and wellbeing in endangered language communities. While the nature of the connection 
between language and wellbeing remains the subject of much debate, the existence of a connection is not 
entirely unexpected, given the range of outcomes associated with wellbeing. In addition, languages 
encode knowledge systems, so language loss represents not only the loss of a communicative system, but

also the loss of traditional knowledge systems. Importantly, traditional knowledge systems encode 
cultural practices related to wellbeing. Understanding the connections between language and wellbeing 
will potentially have implications for public health policy and beyond, but also for language researchers, 
since traditional knowledge systems are among the most threatened domains of endangered language. 
Knowledge of esoteric domains such as botanical classification and traditional medicines is forgotten well 
before basic vocabulary and language structure. Hence, these areas of traditional knowledge are precisely 
the areas which need to be prioritized by language documenters. 
Exploring the connections between language and wellbeing is potentially transformational for language 
documentation and conservation, and thus it will be the theme for the 5th ICLDC. 
Registration for the conference will take place online (no onsite registration) and open on October 1, 2016.  
2017 INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR LANGUAGE STUDIES (ISLS) CONFERENCE 
Call for Proposals Deadline: November 30, 2016 
The International Society for Language Studies, co-sponsored by the University Hawai‘i at Mānoa, will 
hold a conference June 15–17, 2017 at the Hawai‘i Imin International Conference Center in Honolulu. 
The theme of the conference will be “Intersections of Peace and Language Studies.” 
Peace is often defined as freedom from oppression, the end of conflict or even harmony in relationships. 
Whatever the definition, the word peace means different things to different people. Peace is an important 
concept that also connects to the focus of ISLS: the intersections and meeting places of language and 
power, identity, and social justice. It is in this light that we invite proposal submissions that specifically 
address some aspect of this focus and its intersection with the concept of peace. 
The ISLS conference is a venue for individuals from all disciplines to come together and discuss language 
from a critical, interdisciplinary lens (i.e., language use, language learning, language teaching, critical 
language studies, etc.). To that end, we encourage submissions from across fields of study where their 
work connects language to peace. The paper proposal submission opened on the ISLS website in April 
2016, and will conclude on November 30, 2016. Submissions will not be accepted after the November 30 
deadline. Notification of proposal acceptance or rejection will be sent by January 15, 2017. All presenters 
who have not registered for the conference by February 28, 2017 will not be scheduled in the conference 
program. Selected conference papers will be published by ISLS in the Readings in Language Studies 
peer-reviewed book series in 2018.

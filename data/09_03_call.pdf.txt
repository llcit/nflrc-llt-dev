Call for Papers for Special Issue of LLT 
 
Theme: Technology and Learning to Read 
 
Guest Editor: Marlise Horst 
Recent developments in computer technology offer new options for facilitating the acquisition of L2 
reading proficiency and mark an exciting era in L2 reading research. Multimedia programs -- both on and 
off line -- now provide aids to text comprehension such as digital audio, graphics and video, and 
vocabulary resources such as dictionaries, glosses, and concordancers. The Web also offers learners a 
wide range of reading experiences, including exposure to an unprecedented selection of authentic texts, 
and a variety of options for collaborative learning. Other developments include an expanded role for 
computerized corpora in delineating the characteristics of text genres and an increased use of 
computerized methods for assessing reading comprehension and its component skills. This special issue 
of Language Learning & Technology aims to provide a variety of perspectives on these developments in 
both research articles and theoretical discussions of technology-based reading, language acquisition, and 
testing.  
Possible submissions include, but are not limited to: 
• empirical studies that test the efficacy of using technology-based resources (e.g. concordancers, 
dictionaries, or visuals) to support reading comprehension, skill development, and language 
learning 
• investigations of learner use of authentic reading materials on the Web including ways of using 
technology to simplify or supplement authentic texts and the effects of these interventions on 
language development 
• descriptions and tests of corpus-based proposals for delineating text characteristics, designing L2 
reading instruction, and evaluating language learning outcomes   
• studies of computer-based instruments for assessing various aspects of reading proficiency 
• overviews of research on the role of technology in developing reading proficiency 
• overviews of theories or theoretical frameworks for the development of computer-assisted 
reading 
critical perspectives from supporters of paper media 
• investigations related to screen reading and the generational divide  
• studies with an equity perspective on reading development in zones where paper books are 
unaffordable (reverse digital divide) 
Please send an email of intent with a 250 word abstract by December 31, 2005, to llt-editors@hawaii.edu.

University of Hawai‘i National Foreign Language Resource
Center (NFLRC)
Each year, the NFLRC offers intensive  summer institutes for foreign language professionals. The 1998
NFLRC Summer Institute, "Advancing Language Immersion Education," featured a symposium and
workshop for educators representing foreign, indigenous, and heritage language immersion programs.
Check out our website this Fall for information about the 1999 NFLRC Summer Institute entitled "Self-
Instructional Materials Development."
Recent publications from the Hawai'i NFLRC include three new Technical Reports on a variety of topics
related to second language acquisition. In addition, we've added Authentic Indonesian Video (text plus
videotape) to our collection of materials for less commonly taught languages. Feel free to browse through
our other publications--you'll find technical reports, research notes, language teaching materials (text,
video, CD-ROM), and online articles.
Michigan State University Center for Language Education
and Research (CLEAR)
As a culmination of the "Foreign Language Initiative for Distance Learning," CLEAR and EDS
sponsored a videoconference between two Michigan high schools and a high school in Mexico. More
information and pictures from the videoconference can be seen at http://clear.msu.edu/vidconf/index.html.
In addition, Spanish students from Maple Valley High School (Michigan) created a Spanish-language
web site aimed at attracting businesses to the state of Michigan.  The goals of the project were to
familiarize students with Michigan's economic geography, as well as introduce key concepts in marketing
and web site design.
Through collaboration with CLEAR, CIBER, and College of Business, French students from Suttons Bay
High School (Michigan) visited MSU's campus and presented their business plans in French. The Eli
Broad College of Business Complex was the site of the presentations. The audience included
representatives from CLEAR, the College of Business, and native speakers of French.  More information
and photos can be found at http://clear.msu.edu/cbi/french/index.html.
CLEAR also maintains a searchable database of references on the teaching and learning of foreign
language writing focusing on languages other than English (1980-1996). Each reference includes the full
citation and is classified according to several categories.

Apprentissage des Langues et Systèmes d'Information et de
Communication (ALSIC)
ALSIC (Language Learning and Information and Communication Systems) is an electronic journal in
French for researchers and practitioners in fields related to applied linguistics, didactics,
psycholinguistics, educational sciences, computational linguistics, and computer science.
The journal gives priority to papers from the French-speaking community and/or in French, but it also
regularly invites papers in other languages so as to strengthen scientific and technical exchanges between
linguistic communities that too often remain separate. The editorial board of ALSIC invite you to contact
them for any prospective contributions at the following electronic address: alsic@lib.univ-fcomte.fr.
Australian Technology Enhanced Language Learning Consortium (ATELL)
ATELL sponsored the Inaugural WorldCALL Conference: "CALL to Creativity," at The University of

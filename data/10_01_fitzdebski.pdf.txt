ABSTRACT 
The Internet has become an important communication medium and it is having a significant 
impact on language use. The present study takes a “snapshot” of how the Polish language is 
currently used with modern communications technologies by Polish-Australians living in 
Melbourne. Through a questionnaire, it surveys which communications technologies Polish-
Melburnians are familiar with, how and when Polish and English are used for online 
communication, and which language they prefer to use in various circumstances. The study is 
based on the belief that investigations of the natural patterns of new technology use by ethnic 
communities will help us understand how technology could be involved in initiatives aimed at 
increasing the levels of language transmission and maintenance. The present study identifies 
several factors interacting with Internet use in the community language and makes 
recommendations for applications of modern technology in ethnic language schools and for home 
language maintenance. 
 
BACKGROUND 
As a factor mediating human communication and relationships, the Internet is having a significant impact 
on language use in the world, affecting the prospects for and status of languages. Information 
technologies grant languages allied with technologically-advanced countries, such as English, new 
powers of influence (Kibbee, 2003). On the other hand, it is obvious that the same technologies create 
new domains in which minority languages can be employed, support the development of inexpensive and 
widely available language maintenance and learning resources, and extend the global reach of languages 
hitherto confined to local speech communities (Mackey, 2003). 
This two-pronged influence of the Internet, both promoting and endangering languages,  makes any 
prognoses difficult. Though most researchers consider computers as supporting the revitalisation of 
minority languages, the full extent of the impact of the Internet is still unclear and reports are 
contradictory. Villa (2002) and Valiquette (1998) see a role for new technologies in supporting existing 
pedagogies but warn against conceptualising technology as a surrogate for intergenerational transmission. 
Buszard-Welcher (2001) analyses a sample of sites developed by Native Americans and concludes that 
although the Web's potential is growing, its present usefulness for language maintenance is limited as the 
reviewed sites mostly used old methodologies dictated by technology. Nathan (2000) is optimistic about 
the uptake of modern technology by the indigenous peoples of Australia and connects it to traditional 
patterns of knowledge formation and communication. McHenry (2002), however, warns against the 
tendency of associating indigenous language use too strongly with tradition and holds that such 
association may affect language revitalisation negatively. This view is further developed by Warschauer 
(1998) who likewise advocates a harmony between technology and the culturally-conditioned patterns of

communication, but sees the major role of modern technology in promoting the status and relevance of 
minority languages to young people.  
Existing research in the area of technology and language maintenance has mostly been conducted in the 
context of indigenous languages. Studies have noted the positive role of Internet resources in asserting 
ethnic identity (Almasude, 1999), connecting language communities (Benton, 1996), and facilitating 
language maintenance ventures such as development of literacy and implementation of new pedagogies 
(Haag, 2002). Ward and van Genebith (2003) further develop this theme and describe the constraints that 
prevail in the development and application of CALL (computer-assisted language learning) materials in 
the endangered language situation. In contrast, there are only a few studies analysing the significance of 
new technologies for "community languages" (Clyne, 1991), that is, the languages spoken by non-
indigenous ethnic minorities. Borland (2001) describes ethnic cultural broadcasting as "one of the great 
achievements of Australian society" (p.6) and argues that the wide range of programming now available 
in various languages can be extended to include, for example, Web streaming and interactive Web sites. 
Debski (2004) reports on a qualitative analysis of the content of Web sites created by Poles living abroad. 
He reveals a variety of Web site features and online facilities either creating potential for or acting as 
barriers to language development. Borland and Sciriha (2003) consider the advantages of the Web for 
linking dispersed ethnic communities.  Additionally, they develop plans for building a cyberspace 
community for people of Maltese heritage living outside Malta.  
Languages are used in many interactional contexts known as domains. Clyne (1991) analyses several 
domains where community languages are used in Australia such as home, work, neighbourhood, school, 
and local religious community. He also reports on ethnic media such as press, radio, television, and video 
and their role for community languages. Over a decade later, the Internet is both a new arena where 
people work, study, and socialise as well as a medium reshaping those activities. The present paper makes 
the assumption that language use is the sine qua non of language survival. Increasing opportunities to use 
a minority language and available language resources may contribute to its maintenance.  
This investigation takes a "snapshot" of how the Polish language is currently used with modern 
communications technologies by Polish-Melburnians. Through a questionnaire, it surveys which 
technologies, and applications of those technologies, Polish-Melburnians are familiar with, how and when 
Polish and English are used for online communication, and which language they prefer to use in various 
circumstances. It is believed that investigations of the natural patterns of the use of new technologies by 
ethnic communities will help us understand how these tools influence communication in ethnic groups 
and will lay a foundation for work involving technology aimed at increasing the levels of language 
transmission and maintenance. Drawing on the results of the present survey, the paper makes 
recommendations for applications of modern technology in community language education and ethnic 
homes.   
POLISH LANGUAGE IN AUSTRALIA  
Polish migration to Australia started in the early 19th century (Paszkowski, 1982). The first waves of 
Polish immigrants are difficult to document. Until 1921 Poles were not listed as a separate national 
category in Australian censuses due to the government’s lack of recognition of Poland as an independent 
country when it was under foreign occupation and due to the small size of Polish immigration (Drozd, 
2001). Today’s Polish community in Australia is mainly composed of those who arrived during the two 
main waves of Polish immigration, the post World War II wave and the "Solidarity" wave in the 1980s, 
and their descendants. A small number of Poles settled in Australia during the communist period in 
Poland and in the 1990s.  
In Australia, the Polish language is considered by immigrants an important part of Polish identity (Baker, 
1989; Drozd, 2001) and a core cultural value (Smolicz, 1981; Smolicz, Hudson, & Secombe, 2001).

Despite this, Polish belongs to a group of languages with a medium to low maintenance rate. The 1996 
Census revealed a decrease in the number of people speaking Polish at home and the decline of Polish in 
the ranking of most popular languages from ninth position to twelfth (Clyne & Kipp, 1997). The results of 
the 2001 Census further demonstrated the declining trend for Polish (Clyne & Kipp, 2002). If language 
maintenance initiatives are ineffective and there are no future waves of migration, Polish-speaking 
communities may soon cease to exist in Australia.  
THE STUDY 
Participants 
The participants in the study were 56 Polish-Australians living in Melbourne, of whom 57.1% were 
female and 42.9% were male.  They were affiliated with three Polish organisations in Melbourne or were 
friends or family members of those affiliated with these organisations. There were no specific age groups 
or generations targeted by the survey. Of the 56 respondents, 41 were born in Poland, 12 in Australia, two 
in New Zealand, and one in the United Kingdom.  Of the 41 participants who were born in Poland, 22 
(53.7%) lived through the critical period of language development – that is, at least until 12 years of age 
(Patkowski, 1980; Lighbown & Spada, 1999) – in Poland before emigrating. All the participants not born 
in Poland were the first generation born outside Poland.  Participants ranged in age from 14 to 63 and 
over two-thirds of them were under 35 years old (Table 1).

They tended to be very well educated with 42 of the 56 respondents (75.1%) having attended some 
university (Table 2). The participants in this exploratory study do not form a representative sample of the 
Polish community in Melbourne.  Questionnaires were gathered from a variety of organisations, such as a 
youth group, scouts, and a Polish church, in hope that the demographic of the members would vary in age 
and education. As there was little control over who responded to the questionnaire, it seems that the title 
of the questionnaire ("Survey of the Use of Networked Communication in the Polish Language by Polish-
Australians in Melbourne") attracted younger respondents who were more familiar with technology or 
participants with higher education who were more interested in networked communication. This was 
anticipated, as the primary aim of the study was to capture the patterns and attitudes among those who 
used new technologies. Although the study also comments on the levels of uptake of modern 
communications technology and its use through Polish, these results are only representative of the non-
random sample used in the present study. 
In 1996, 44% of the Polish-born population in Australia were over sixty years of age. Aging population is 
in fact one of the main challenges for the Polish community in Australia (Jupp, 2003). In contrast, the

present sample is characterised by young age and a high level of education. Most of those who responded 
to the questionnaire belonged to the 1980s Solidarity wave of Polish immigration or more recent 
emigration, or were the children of those who had left Poland in those years. The high level of education 
amongst the Solidarity wave is well documented. For example, in the sample used in Drozd (2001), 40% 
of participants had at least some university education.

Data collection and analysis 
The survey was conducted using a self-completion questionnaire containing six sections modeled on 
Davis (1994) (See Appendix). The first section asked participants for background demographic 
information.  The second section was on language use and asked participants to give examples of which 
language they use with certain people and why they use that language.  This section also was used to 
reveal the participants’ motivations towards being able to speak Polish.  The third section on the 
connections participants had with the Polish community helped determine their needs to communicate in 
Polish.  In section four, participants were asked to assess their own Polish literacy and, in section five, 
their experience using technology.  Section five also asked participants which applications of technology 
they use in Polish and which in English, as well as concerning their need to use technology to 
communicate in Polish. The final section asked participants to imagine which languages they would use 
in certain situations.  It also asked their opinion on whether they saw the Internet as a motivator to speak 
English or Polish.  
Two forms of the questionnaire were used: a paper version and an online version. The paper 
questionnaires were distributed in an informal atmosphere during meetings, such as the meeting of Polish 
scouts, after a Polish mass, or at the offices of Polish organisations.  Participants completed the 
questionnaire in their own time and were encouraged to pass it on to their family members and friends. Of 
the 56 participants, 41 completed the online version. On the whole, responses received from the online 
questionnaire tended to be longer and more thoughtful.  
All participants were given a plain language statement in both English and Polish explaining the research. 
They then read and signed a consent form, also available in English and Polish versions, or gave their 
consent to participate by clicking a box on the online version of the survey.  
For analysis, quantitative data, such as age, place of birth, home language, frequency of computer use and 
experience with communicative technologies, were entered into SPSS 10 for statistical analysis.

Descriptive statistics on all variables were run in order to be able to describe the research participants and 
to see in which directions the data may be skewed. Correlations were also used, helping to establish 
whether a relationship existed between several of the measured variables and, if there was a relationship, 
to see if it was significant. Qualitative data from the survey were used in the study to illustrate and 
support quantitative trends. 
RESULTS 
Patterns of Polish language use and literacy 
Of the 56 respondents, only two "never" spoke Polish at home. 76% of the respondents spoke Polish at 
home either "most of the time" or "all of the time." The majority of respondents indicated that they spoke 
Polish "most of the time" (Table 3).

The majority of participants, over 69%, responded as speaking Polish "sometimes" when they were 
outside their home.  Only one participant responded that she spoke Polish "all the time" outside the home 
due to her job; however, she spoke English occasionally at home with her children.  The two participants 
who reported not speaking Polish at all at home noted that they were able to speak it "sometimes" at work 
with clients (Table 4).

Participants who indicated that Polish was spoken "most of the time" often reported speaking to other 
family members in English or a mix of Polish and English. Most often, participants reported using 
English with their siblings because it was a more natural language to communicate in.  Parents also 
responded that they spoke English occasionally to their children to make sure that what they said was 
understood.  One parent for example said, "I often speak English to my son to avoid misunderstandings, 
especially if I am in a hurry or he finds it difficult to follow what I say in Polish. This applies to more 
complex issues."  Several younger participants said that they could speak Polish but often answered their 
parents in English because it was easier. There were many responses from parents or their children that 
parents are making conscious choices to speak Polish at home in order that all their children will be able 
to speak the language.

Polish is often consciously chosen by the younger generation to communicate to older Polish-Australians.  
One teenager wrote, "I speak Polish only to older Polish people.  When I talk to Polish people my age I 
speak in English."  A 14 year-old male respondent born in Poland wrote, "I speak Polish to my parents, 
uncles, aunties, grandparents, all the older Polish people, mostly because they speak better Polish and it’s 
easier for them and it just comes to me naturally." Some Polish-Australian youths did report using Polish 
to their peers, but English is more natural and Polish was used more for fun and not to be understood by 
others. A 39 year-old woman wrote about speaking to an Australian-born Polish-Australian friend saying, 
"We mostly use English spicing it with Polish words occasionally mostly for fun." 
Almost three quarters of those completing the questionnaire reported having "good" to "very good" 
writing ability in Polish (Table 5).

Some of the younger participants said however that they were not confident about writing in Polish.  
Indeed, when correlated, the relationship between the respondents' age and their self-reported writing 
ability was moderately significant (Table 6).  
Table 6. Correlations

Writing ability and reading ability in Polish 0.591 53 .000 
Writing ability and age when leaving Poland 0.713 38 .000 
 
A stronger correlation was found between having been educated in Poland until at least 12 years of age 
and writing ability (r = .5462). The correlation between having been educated through this critical period 
and being able to read in Polish was not significant (r = .224, p < 0.097) (Table 6).  
As might be expected, the correlation between reading in Polish and writing ability was moderately strong 
(Table 6).  Of those surveyed, 14.3% answered that they could not read in Polish, corresponding closely 
to the 12.5% of those who said they wrote "poorly" or "not at all" in Polish.  The greatest factor 
contributing to higher writing ability for those who immigrated to Australia is having left Poland at a later 
age.  This correlation is convincingly strong (r = .713). 
The younger participants, a mix of those born in Australia and those born in Poland and having moved 
when they were quite young, are mixed in their abilities and willingness to read and write in Polish.  One 
respondent, a 15 year-old boy who arrived with his parents when he was 2 years old, said, "I know how to 
read in Polish, but I can’t be bothered reading anything."  Another respondent, a 20 year-old female, 
wrote that reading in Polish is "too hard and I am very lazy."

Internet access 
The majority of participants taught themselves how to use the Internet and they use it for a wide variety of 
purposes.  Several teens responded that they used the Internet in order to chat with their friends or play 
online multi-user games.  Adults used the Internet as well for chatting and e-mail, but also for online 
banking.  All generations used the Internet for learning or knowledge gathering, be it for a university 
course or research as part of a secondary school assignment.  Both groups also learnt how to use the 
Internet because of the novelty of it several years ago.  
Polish language use on the Internet 
In all domains of Internet use, the Polish-Australians in the study reported using more of the features in 
English than in Polish (Table 7). Correlations between the use of one type of technology in English and in 
Polish were weak, aside from the use of chat (r = .523, df = 54, p < .000) and Internet radio (r = .535, df = 
54, p < .000) in both languages.  That is to say, writing e-mails or surfing the Internet in English, for 
example, is not an indicator of a particular participant's ability or willingness to do so in Polish.

Media used to communicate in Polish 
In communicating with those living in Poland, telephone is still the preferred method (Table 8).  
Respondents cite being able to hear their loved ones’ voices as a reason they like speaking on the 
telephone.  Poland’s lagging development of Internet infrastructure is another reason that using Internet 
tools can be frustrating, especially for relatives living in Poland. Participants regard telephoning as almost 
as good as face-to-face communication in situations when communication may be difficult or very 
important.  With other technologies, it is difficult to know if the message was received or to judge the 
response of the recipient.  Telephone offers a means for the messenger to tailor the delivery to the 
situation.

Opinions differed on whether e-mail was suitable for formal communication. Some said that it should be 
used for informal communication and it would never replace formal and traditional letter writing. Among 
survey participants, letter writing was a popular way to communicate to family in Poland. A respondent 
mentioned, "It makes people feel special if they receive mail."  One participant took the aspect of 
formality of writing a step further and said that a telegram is a very special way to mark a formal event, 
such as by sending wedding greetings when unable to attend personally. One 53 year-old male said, "I 
consider telephone or letter more appropriate in emotional situations, and when politeness or formality are 
the issue." Another respondent, a 15 year-old female, said however that sending an e-mail as a greeting 
was as appropriate as sending a letter through the post except faster. Survey participants responded that e-
mail was a convenient and cheap way to communicate to family members in Poland due to the either 
eight or ten hour time gap (depending on the time of year). Respondents tended to agree that, despite 
sometimes being impersonal as compared to a hand-written letter, e-mail is a preferred medium of 
communication because it is inexpensive and quick. 
The study also noted a moderate statistical association between those who write e-mails in Polish and 
their ability to read in Polish (r = .471, df = 54, p < .000), similar to the correlation between reading and 
self-assessed writing ability mentioned above.  The more one reads, the better that person’s writing seems 
to be. 
SMS, the sending of short text messages from one mobile telephone to another, in Polish is also popular 
among Polish-Australians.  When reporting on hypothetical situations, several respondents said that when 
using SMS they would write in English even if it were to a Polish-Australian audience or mix the two 
languages.  SMS name day greetings, however, would have to be given in Polish, as one survey 
participant wrote, as would messages sent to mobile phone users in Poland.  A 21 year-old respondent 
made a comment about her favourite and least favourite facets of SMS: "Favourite: great when you can’t 
be bothered talking, quick message, cheap for overseas communication, great for flirting!  Least 
favourite: it gets addictive."  
A cross-tabulation (Table 9) of the data on Polish technology usage enabled a distinction to be drawn 
between those raised in Poland through the critical period of language development (in this research, age 
12) and those participants who were not -- either by leaving Poland before that age or by being born 
outside Poland and not having returned. This table shows that those living in Poland through the critical 
period were more likely to use technologies dependent on written Polish such as email, newsgroups, 
SMS, and e-greeting cards.

Factors interacting with Internet use of Polish 
All but three respondents reported first learning to use the Internet in English. Participants were asked to 
comment on how the Internet either encourages or discourages the use of a particular language. Most 
survey participants said that the user could choose to view or use Polish Internet content over similar 
English sites.  Some respondents said, however, that Polish was discouraged by the sheer number of 
English language sites. A respondent who emigrated from Poland in the early 1980s said that she 
preferred the English version of the Internet as she has not been developing her Polish language 
vocabulary in the last 20 years.  On the other hand, she thought that the Polish version of the Internet was 
good "to become more familiar with the current Polish language." Another participant wrote that e-mail 
might discourage the use of Polish due to the English-language interfaces of e-mail providers in Australia 
or because participants are more comfortable using English when using computers.  While other 
participants mentioned the lack of support for Polish characters, this participant said that e-mail was not a 
skill that she developed within the language and that many other Polish-Australians probably learnt to use 
e-mail in English.  
A 16 year-old female Polish-language school student recognised the limitations of using Polish on the 
Web.  As opposed to English, "you can only use Polish on the Internet if … you are in a Polish site 
looking for information in Polish.  I find that the use of Polish on the Internet has helped me practice … 
reading and writing." Participants agree that the Internet does offer opportunities to become more literate 
in both Polish and English, but Polish content has less of a chance of being accessed than English-
language content because of the large amount of English-language web sites. Polish-language content is 
available, including music and movies, but it is up to the user to take the initiative to access this 
information. 
DISCUSSION  
Language use is the sine qua non of language survival. Language maintenance initiatives are therefore 
focused on widening the use of an endangered language by, for example, improving its official status, 
strengthening its distinctive functions in society, increasing its presence in the mass media and education, 
or changing negative attitudes towards it. As a major force influencing both local and global 
communication, the Internet is having a significant impact on the access that emigrants have to their 
native languages and therefore on their use. Although overall they reported using more of the features of 
the Internet in English than in Polish, the Polish-Australians in the study reported using eight different 
domains of the Internet in Polish. The present study does not provide definitive results regarding the 
impact of new technologies on language maintenance. It demonstrates however that use of Polish with 
modern technologies (Internet, SMS) by the younger members of the Polish community in Melbourne 
seems to be a popular phenomenon and must be included in language maintenance research among the 
traditional communication channels used to maintain links with Polish culture and language such as 
letters, phone calls, travel to Poland, and inviting family from Poland (cf. Drozd, 2001).  
It is important to investigate when people use modern communications technologies in their community 
languages and when in the dominant language and what the factors are affecting language choice. From 
the language maintenance perspective, use of modern technologies in the community language may be 
seen as contributing to language maintenance. External or personal barriers to such use should therefore 
be identified and described and must be taken into account by maintenance initiatives. This should 
include the development of language teaching materials and procedures for community language schools 
(cf. Ward & van Genebith, 2003).   
The present survey has discovered several factors affecting language choice when using communications 
technologies. It noted many complaints concerning the lack of support for typing Polish characters in e-
mails. Although the introduction of Macintosh OS X and Windows XP has improved the equal status of

languages on the Internet, the situation of Polish in emigrant contexts is still far from perfect. 
Technological solutions are now in place, but a lot can still be done to sensitise administrators and 
technical supervisors at all levels to the linguistic needs of minorities using computers. Another external 
factor affecting selection of Web sites in the community language noted by the survey was the 
overwhelming size of the English-language Internet so that English language sites have a much greater 
chance of being selected.  
Were all external factors affecting the use of community languages on the Internet to be removed, 
emigrants would still have to make a personal choice which language to use each time they switch on 
their computers. The respondents in the present study often indicated the importance of personal choice 
and motivation. Although the aim of using communications technology would be a primary motivator of 
language choice, some respondents have indicated that the language of first/early exposure to the Internet 
may have an impact on future choice of language for Internet use. All but three respondents reported first 
learning to use the Internet in English, which may have influenced their overall preference for using 
English as evidenced in the survey. Also, respondents commented that e-mail skills were not something 
that they had developed in Polish and that was why they preferred to use English for electronic mail.  
If indeed it is true that those who are introduced to Internet communication in the community language 
are more likely to select this language in the future, it is imperative for community language schools, as 
well as for parents at home, to introduce children early on to the use of the Internet in the community 
language. More research must be conducted on this issue; appropriate pedagogical Internet resources must 
be identified; and specific teaching methodologies and techniques must be developed for ethnic schools 
and for parents raising children in more than one language. Consultations with ethnic communities in 
Melbourne demonstrate that parents often do not know about the existence of Internet language learning 
resources for children and many are reluctant to encourage their children to use the Internet. It is 
important for parents and teachers to be familiar with the issues of safety on the Internet (e.g., "Child 
Safety on the Information Superhighway"). 
Ability to read and write in the community language is another personal factor affecting language choice 
on the Internet. The survey has discovered a correlation between use of e-mail in Polish and the ability to 
read in Polish. The Internet is and at least for some time will be a written medium. While people coming 
from bilingual backgrounds usually develop good oral/aural skills in the community language used at 
home, they rarely develop biliteracy. If children and youths from multilingual backgrounds are to be 
encouraged to use the Internet for social communication, school work, and research in the community 
language, it is necessary to strengthen the teaching of reading and writing in families and ethnic schools 
(cf. Nicholas, Debski & Lagerberg, 2004). Computer tutors, games, and computer-mediated 
communication are excellent tools for the teaching of writing skills and their use should be encouraged in 
ethnic schools and homes. Children could be assisted in finding key-pals (old "pen-pals") in the country 
of origin. Internet-based tandem learning, involving two learners who learn each other’s first language, is 
a technique well developed in mainstream language teaching (Appel & Mullen, 2000). Its benefits for the 
development of cultural understanding (Meagher & Castanos, 1996) and learner autonomy 
(Schwienhorst, 2003; Ushioda, 2000) are also well described. Writing chain stories using e-mail is 
another example of a simple and effective technique that can be used with younger children by both 
parents and teachers, and so is creation of DVDs and Web diaries, blogs, from holidays and trips that can 
be viewed by family and friends in Poland.  
Similarly, lack of up-to-date vocabulary was also perceived as a barrier to using the Polish Internet. Once 
the lexical barrier is overcome through provision of support at home and in ethnic schools, however, the 
Internet can in fact be seen as an important source of up-to-date "living" language for ethnic communities, 
and thus can work towards language maintenance.

Constraints determining the requirements of community language CALL may significantly differ from 
the constraints proposed by Ward & van Genebith (2003) for endangered languages and therefore need a 
separate treatment. The authors for example write that lack of computer literacy can be an important 
barrier, as often is the case with underprivileged minority groups.  The present data demonstrated 
however that most of the respondents had good understanding of the potential of the computer, and many 
members of the community could be asked to both provide technical support to ethnic education and 
support their children in the home environment.  
Not all technologies were equally popular among the respondents. Assessment of the match between goal 
and medium made by the user was an important factor affecting the choice of communication 
technologies by the Polish-Australians in the study. Hearing the voice of a loved member of the family 
seems very important for the participants and that is why, in the age of the Internet, the telephone still 
remains their favourite means of communication with family members. Interestingly, when emigrants 
choose communication technologies, they assess how a given technology mediates messages. As a 
medium, many respondents regarded e-mail as either too informal or impersonal in some situations in 
which the respondents would prefer to use the hand-written letter or even telegram. For others, the 
asynchronous character of e-mail would make it a convenient communication tool helping overcome the 
time difference between Australia and Poland. This result shows for example that e-mail is a more 
important means of communication for Polish emigrants in Australia than chat or other synchronous 
communication tools. This preference may be different for other communities, for example Korean or 
Japanese, where time difference is not an important factor.  
Language contact and change in the virtual world cannot be considered in separation from real world 
factors because Internet use of community languages is affected by human attitudes, technical 
infrastructure, and educational practices. At the same time, the ways in which immigrant and ethnic 
communities use media can influence the status of community languages, human attitudes towards them, 
and the practices in their teaching and learning. While the survey shows that "cultural broadcasting" 
(Borland, 2001) through television and radio still plays an important role in the lives of Polish-
Australians, so increasingly do interactive technologies such as e-mail, SMS and chat. The data clearly 
show that the Internet has increased the quantity of contacts with ethnic language material. How new 
interactive technologies change the quality of interaction between ethnic individuals and their home 
countries and between communities around the world speaking the same language is another interesting 
area of investigation. The present study confirms the results of Debski (2004) and shows that interactive 
technologies expose Polish emigrants to up-to-date language of their age or professional peers and 
increase opportunities for individuals to use community languages to accomplish social, educational, and 
professional goals. We need to know more about how associating Internet use of community languages 
with life objectives affects motivation to maintain, transfer, and learn community languages. Overall, we 
need to understand better the significance of the change of the role of technology in language 
maintenance from a tool of cultural broadcasting to an environment for cultural participation. Today, 
emigrants create their own Web sites where they publish poetry or accounts of emigration experiences. 
They participate in online events involving celebrities in the country of origin, and they can express their 
political or cultural views (Debski, 2004). Such new opportunities may generate the sense of increased 
participation in the culture of origin and a feeling of greater influence on social and cultural events in the 
country of origin. Virtual communication provides opportunities for goal-oriented, functional use of 
language, helping ethnic community members either develop (second generation) or maintain (first 
generation) "secondary discourse" (Fettes, 1997), needed to communicate with people outside the 
immediate circle of family and friends.  
We need more research aimed at developing specific teaching methodologies and techniques utilising 
goal-oriented use of language on the Internet for community and ethnic schools and parents. Edwards, 
Pemberton, Knight, and Monoghan (2002) report on a European Union project called "Fabula" aimed at 
Michael Fitzgerald & Robert Debski Internet Use of Polish by Polish Melburnians: Implications for

Language Learning & Technology 98 
building a tool allowing children from bilingual backgrounds to create bilingual books. They describe 
how creating such electronic books involves collaboration between students, teachers, and parents and 
offers opportunities to write for real audiences, which acts as a motivator for learners. Creating electronic 
projects with a real-life appeal is a well-explored area in language teaching and learning (Barson & 
Debski, 1996; Barson 1999; Debski, 2000). Project-oriented approaches seem particularly useful in 
minority language teaching (cf. Warschauer, 1998), where creative links can be developed between the 
language classroom and ethnic community groups or individual members acting as the audience and 
source of information for student projects. Electronic links can also be created between community 
language students abroad and institutions in the home country, such as schools or universities. 
Technology can act as an important tool inspiring the renovation of approaches and methods used in 
ethnic language teaching and contributing to increasing the status of learning a minority language. 
Employment of technology may contribute to developing in the minds of the Australian-born descendants 
a view of Poland as a modern country and to increasing their interest in the Polish language and culture.  
The impact of new technologies on community language maintenance is an obvious gap in research, 
which has not had adequate treatment by either mainstream language maintenance research or research in 
CMC (computer-mediated communication). The first has not yet fully incorporated Internet 
communication into its frameworks and often treats the Internet as a single technology without 
considering the specific features of its media  (e.g. e-mail, chat, virtual reality) and their ability to 
transform social relationships and communication. In CMC research, on the other hand, studies based on 
minority language data are still rare and little connection has to date been made with the current models of 
language maintenance in the "real" world (Danet and Herring, 2003). 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, the present study has found that nearly all the Polish-Melburnians in the study used the 
Internet daily for a variety of purposes. All the generations used the Internet for learning or knowledge 
gathering. Use of Polish on the Internet is a popular phenomenon among Polish-Melburnians in the study. 
The participants reported using eight different domains of the Internet in Polish. However, they used more 
of the features of the Internet in English than in Polish. Correlations between the use of one type of 
technology in English and use of that same technology in Polish were weak.  Being able to use one type 
of technology in English therefore is not a strong indicator of a participant's ability to use the same 
technology in Polish. 
Polish emigrants choose a communication medium that matches their communicative goals. In 
communicating with those living in Poland, the telephone is still the preferred method as a means 
allowing the messenger to hear the voice of loved ones and to tailor the delivery to the situation. E-mail is 
the second most popular technology used to communicate in Polish. The study has discovered several 
factors interacting with Internet use in the community language:  
• Lack of support for typing special characters in e-mails 
• Overwhelming size of the English-language Internet so that English language sites have a much 
greater chance of being selected  
• Language of first/early exposure to the Internet and/or specific Internet channels 
• Lack of ability to read and write 
• Contemporary (unknown) lexical items 
Finally, the study has found that interactive technologies expose Polish emigrants to up-to-date language 
of their age or professional peers.  
Several recommendations for language maintenance and learning initiatives can be based on the results of 
the present study. It is important for individuals and organisations to influence administrators of 
computers located in various institutions (e.g. universities, schools, libraries) to make them capable in as

many languages as possible. Parents and ethnic schools must introduce children early on to the use of the 
Internet in the community language and increase the emphasis on developing biliteracy. Ethnic schools 
should use task-based and project-oriented CALL methodologies, recognizing that the Internet is an 
environment for cultural participation providing opportunities for goal-oriented, functional language use.  
Ethnic school education should look for ways to use the technical expertise of the members of the 
community to support pedagogical initiatives. It seems that CALL could be utilised as a tool fueling the 
renovation of the ethnic school's language curricula.  
The present study has investigated the use of Polish with Internet technologies by a sample of young and 
well-educated Polish-Melburnians. Similar studies must be conducted with different ethnic communities 
to allow comparisons. For example, it would be interesting to see how different emigrant cultures choose 
different online communication channels and use them to achieve their communicative goals and what are 
the constraints for different communities. It would also be interesting to see what different communities 
see as barriers to more popular use of modern technologies through the community language. Such 
investigations would not only contribute to research of language maintenance, but would enrich what we 
know about cross-cultural CMC in general. Such investigations are also necessary for the development of 
policies, approaches, and techniques suitable for Community Language CALL.

Abstract 
Many types of L2 phonological perception are often difficult to acquire without instruction. These 
difficulties with perception may also be related to intelligibility in production. Instruction on perception 
contrasts is more likely to be successful with the use of phonetically variable input made available 
through computer-assisted pronunciation training. However, few computer-assisted programs have 
demonstrated flexibility in diagnosing and treating individual learner problems or have made effective 
use of linguistic resources such as corpora for creating training materials. This study introduces a system 
for segmental perceptual training that uses a computational approach to perception utilizing corpus-
based word frequency lists, high variability phonetic input, and text-to-speech technology to 
automatically create discrimination and identification perception exercises customized for individual 
learners. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated in an experiment with pre- and post-test design, 
involving 32 adult Russian-speaking learners of English as a foreign language. The participants’ 
perceptual gains were found to transfer to novel voices, but not to untrained words. Potential factors 
underlying the absence of word-level transfer are discussed. The results of the training model provide an 
example for replication in language teaching and research settings.

Introduction 
In the early 21st century, three trends in second language (L2) pronunciation instruction emerged. First, 
teaching pronunciation regained once-lost attention in L2 pedagogy (Derwing & Munro, 2015), and a 
consensus formed that the development of intelligible speech was the primary goal for pronunciation 
instruction. Second, learner-centered pedagogies became critical for effective pronunciation acquisition. 
Specifically, pronunciation instruction increasingly recognized that not all errors were equally important, 
and that different learners required different instructional emphases. Third, the ever-increasing use of 
computer-assisted language learning (CALL) tools penetrated all areas of L2 pedagogy, including 
pronunciation. Computer-assisted pronunciation teaching (CAPT) applications have proved capable of 
adapting to individual learners, something that is extremely challenging in conventional classroom 
settings, especially for large class sizes as in many English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts 
(Bahanshal, 2013; Liang, 2009). 
However, in current CAPT applications, little use has been made of the available linguistic and 
70 Language Learning & Technology 
 
technology resources (e.g., word frequency lists, spoken language databases, and text-to-speech 
technology), and many CAPT applications show limited flexibility in diagnosing and treating individual 
learner problems. Some applications claiming to reduce accent have been over-commercialized into tech-
showy packages that attract buyers but do not effectively serve the goal of pronunciation instruction (Neri, 
Cucchiarini, Strik, & Boves, 2002; Thomson, 2013). Arguably, a model is yet to be developed that would 
help improve pronunciation intelligibility through a flexible approach to pronunciation instruction. Ideally, 
such a model should build upon the cutting-edge research on the effect of high variability phonetic 
training (Thomson, 2011, 2012; Wang & Munro, 2004). This article describes an attempt to introduce a 
first iteration of such a model, exemplified in a prototype CAPT tool that provides perceptual training of 
English segmental features for L2 learners. 
This article is organized as follows: First, we review the relevant literature on the importance of 
proficiency in L2 segmental perception, the desired pedagogical approaches for L2 segmental instruction, 
and limitations of the existing perceptual training models. Then, we introduce the design of a novel CAPT 
tool that bridges the gap between research and practice in L2 perceptual training. Finally, we present an 
empirical study to assess the effectiveness of the tool and the transfer of learning according to Levis’ 
(2007) CAPT evaluative framework. 
Literature Review 
Selectively Teaching L2 Segmentals 
The importance of segmental features (segmentals) to intelligibility is well-documented (e.g., Jenkins, 
2000; Munro & Derwing, 2006), but segmentals do not require equal pedagogical attention in all contexts, 
in that not all segmental errors compromise intelligibility to the same extent (Brown, 1988). A generally 
accepted principle that informs pedagogical choices is the functional load (FL) principle, which measures 
“the work which two phonemes (or a distinctive feature) do in keeping utterances apart” (King, 1967, p. 
631) and serves to rank the gravity of phonemic errors. Appendix A lists a 10-point scale error gravity 
hierarchy (larger numbers represent greater error gravity) for commonly confused British English 
phonemic contrasts (Brown, 1988). Later empirical research demonstrates a correlation between the FL 
value of a phoneme and its impact on intelligibility. Munro and Derwing (2006) analyzed the relation 
between English phoneme error types and comprehensibility ratings by native listener judges and found 
that errors with sound pairs of high FL (/l–n/, /ʃ–s/, and /d–z/) resulted in greater loss of comprehensibility, 
while comprehensibility was not impacted as seriously for errors with low FL (/ð–d/ and /θ–f/). The 
impact of FL on listeners’ ability to understand was also sensitive to error frequency. The researchers 
noted that comprehensibility was worse for sentences with two high FL errors than one and that 
“sentences that contained only one high FL error were rated significantly worse for comprehensibility 
than sentences containing three low FL errors” (p. 528). 
Segmental errors for non-native speakers tend to be first language (L1) specific (Flege et al., 2006; Jia, 
Strange, Wu, Collado, & Guan, 2006). For instance, /i–ɪ/ is notoriously problematic for Chinese speakers 
but does not seem to affect Arabic speakers to the same extent (Swan & Smith, 2002). The influence of 
L1 on L2 phonological acquisition is well recognized in L2 pronunciation research. According to the 
speech learning model (Flege, 1995) and the Perceptual Assimilation Model (Best, 1995), learners’ ability 
to perceive and produce L2 phonemes are partly predictable from the acoustic distance between the target 
phonemes and the learners’ native phonemes. A major reason for this is the hypothesis that L2 
phonological acquisition attainment is often linked with the age when L2 acquisition starts (Scovel, 1969). 
As part of the declining process, learners lose the acuity to perceive the phonetic categories of a foreign 
language (Best & MacRoberts, 2003). Some believe that this loss can be reinforced by continual L1 
acquisition, making ears increasingly attuned to native acoustic features (Iverson, Hazan, & Bannister, 
2005). As a consequence, when hearing an unfamiliar phoneme, adult learners are inclined to filter the 
sound through their native phonetic inventory, trying to map the foreign phoneme to L1 representations in 
close proximity. 
Manman Qian, Evgeny Chukharev-Hudilainen, and John Levis 71 
 
However, speakers sharing an L1 may not experience the same difficulties in acquiring segmentals. For 
example, segmental errors such as /l–n/ substitution with Mandarin speakers are regionally dependent 
despite having the same L1 as other speakers without /l–n/ substitution errors (Richards, 2012). Munro, 
Derwing, and Thomson (2015) monitored the performance in English consonant productions of 17 
Mandarin speakers and 23 Slavic speakers over the course of two years, during which no explicit 
pronunciation instruction was provided. Despite similarities (which were expected) among learners of the 
same L1, the types of difficulties faced by the learners varied dramatically—among the 21 sounds 
examined for the two L1 groups, only one sound, coda /ld/, was uniformly difficult to the Mandarin 
participants, whereas for each of the other 20 sounds, a good proportion (at least 20% and on most 
occasions over 40%) of the participants did not show pronunciation problems, raising questions about a 
strictly L1-based pedagogy. 
There is also evidence that some L2 segmentals may not require explicit teaching. For instance, Munro 
and Derwing (2008) observed that some Mandarin and Slavic speakers learned to correctly produce 
English vowels that did not exist in their L1s without instruction (such as /ɪ/, /ʊ/, and /ʌ/) during their 
initial months of stay in the target language country. Munro et al. (2015) further noted that some 
segmental problems were self-corrected over time by at least some learners. 
All these findings have important implications for the teaching of L2 segmentals, in that teaching 
materials need to be prepared in both a principled and flexible fashion. Specifically, only the segmentals 
with high FLs should be selected for pronunciation syllabi. At the same time, materials should also be 
fine-tuned to address different L1s and for individual learners within an L1 group. 
Necessity of Perceptual Training 
L2 perceptual training is necessary not only because natural L2 perceptual acquisition is challenging for 
adult learners due to their potential lack of perception of foreign sounds, but also because perceptual 
training facilitates oral production. Many researchers view perception as a necessary precursor for 
production (Bongaerts, van Summeren, Planken, & Schils, 1997; Denes & Pinson, 1963; Kim, 2005; 
Neufeld, 1988). Research suggests a precedent relationship of perception development to production 
achievement (e.g., Baker & Trofimovich, 2001; Detey & Racine, 2015; Walden, 2014), such that 
perceptual insufficiency tends to inhibit production performance (Flege, Bohn, & Jang, 1997; Iverson et 
al., 2005). The indispensable role of perception to production may be further strengthened by recent 
neurolinguistic discoveries that the ability to perceive is essential to accurate articulation (Golestani & 
Pallier, 2007). However, the perception-precedes-production hypothesis has remained controversial, 
especially with growing work showing that production development can be achieved through 
interventions other than perceptual training, such as visual feedback (Gick, Bernhardt, Bacsfalvi, & 
Wilson, 2008; Olson, 2014; Patten & Edmonds, 2015; Suemitsu, Dang, Ito, & Tiede, 2015). Despite the 
controversies, one phenomenon that holds true is that the development of perception and production is 
inextricably linked. The mutually facilitative interaction between perception and production has been 
demonstrated in a great many studies (e.g., Catford & Pisoni, 1970; Linebaugh & Roche, 2013, 2015; 
Pimsleur, 1963; Wang, Jongman, & Sereno, 2003), including perceptual research conducted specifically 
at the segmental level (Bradlow, Pisoni, Yamada, & Tohkura, 1997; Bradlow, Yamada, Pisoni, & 
Tohkura, 1999; Lambacher, Martens, Kakehi, Marasinghe, & Molholt, 2005; Lopez-Soto & Kewley-Port, 
2009; Okuno & Hardison, 2016; Rochet, 1995; Rvachew, 1994; Thomson, 2011). 
CAPT and High-Variability Phonetic Training in Perceptual Training 
Technology has been utilized for pronunciation teaching effectively in a variety of forms. Research has 
shown that general L2 pronunciation skills can be strengthened by the use of audio recordings (Hardison, 
2003, 2005), podcasts (O’Bryan & Hegelheimer, 2007), and text-to-speech (TTS) technology (Kiliçkaya, 
2008). Acoustic analysis is often found to benefit L2 pronunciation instruction for a variety of features, 
including intonation (Levis & Pickering, 2004), stress (Coniam, 2002), rhythm (Coniam, 2002; Varden, 
2006), and segmentals (Lambacher, 1999). Automated speech recognition feedback has also been 
72 Language Learning & Technology 
 
reported to have a positive effect on improving L2 English production (Hincks, 2003, 2005; McCrocklin, 
2016; Walker, Trofimovich, Cedergren, & Gatbonton, 2011). In addition to their effect on L2 English 
pronunciation learning, technology can also promote non-English phonological acquisition (Chun, Jiang, 
Meyr, & Yang, 2015: Mandarin tones; Ducate & Lomicka, 2009: German and French pronunciation; 
Hardison, 2004: French prosody and segmentals; Hirata, 2004: Japanese intonation; Hirata & Kelly, 2010: 
Japanese segmentals; Kawai & Hirose, 2000: Japanese phonemes; Lord, 2008: Spanish pronunciation; 
Motohashi-Saigo & Hardison, 2009: Japanese segmentals). Specific to the development of segmental 
perception, the focus of the current study, computer-mediated auditory training has also been reported as 
efficacious in a number of studies (Iverson & Evans, 2009; Nishi & Kewley-Port, 2007, 2008; Thomson, 
2011, 2012; Wang & Munro, 2004). 
Perception training can be effectively carried out using high-variability phonetic training (HVPT), which 
relies on speech input produced in multiple phonetic contexts by multiple voices (Pisoni & Lively, 
1995).1 A plethora of studies have reported HVPT as effective for perceptual training. Both synthetic 
(Jamieson & Morosan, 1986, 1989; Strange & Dittmann, 1984) and natural voices (Lively, Logan, & 
Pisoni, 1993; Lively, Pisoni, Yamada, Tohkura, & Yamada, 1994; Logan, Lively, & Pisoni, 1991) have 
been used for creating HVPT materials in experiments (although little work has compared the 
effectiveness of the two stimulus types). Evidence supports the superiority of HVPT over techniques 
using single-talker stimuli in facilitating L2 perception development (Lambacher et al., 2005; Wang et al., 
2003; Wang & Munro, 2004; Wang, Spence, Jongman, & Sereno, 1999). HVPT has also been recognized 
as effective for promoting the transfer of perceptual gains from trained to untrained words and talkers 
(e.g., Bradlow et al., 1997; Bradlow, 2008; Carlet & Cebrian, 2014; Iverson et al., 2005). The model has 
also provided positive perceptual training results on English segmentals such as /ɛ/ and /æ/ in CAPT 
applications (Thomson, 2011, 2012). 
Lack of Flexibility in Existing CAPT Programs 
Despite the significant body of research outlined above, the full potential of CAPT has not been realized 
in perceptual L2 segmental training. For example, adaptive learner models, used in some CALL 
applications (Chukharev-Hudilainen & Klepikova, 2016) have not been sufficiently applied to CAPT. 
Levis (2007) argues for the use of adaptive modeling in this context: 
The [segmental training] system should assist learners and teachers in prioritizing pronunciation 
topics by channeling learners toward typical vowel and consonant errors for their language 
backgrounds. For example, a Korean learner of English would, after setting up a user profile, be 
directed to pronunciation topics that are problematic for Korean learners. … Even better than this 
rather crude channeling mechanism would be an error diagnostic informed by language specific 
filtering. A diagnostic component in a CAPT system should include perception elements in which 
learners identify and discriminate among problematic sounds. (p. 188) 
Munro et al. (2015) also argue that “an ideal [segmental training] approach would be a … CAPT system 
that diagnoses individual learner difficulties and provides remedial exercises in exactly the areas needed” 
(p. 54). On the other hand, they also pointed out that such an approach did not exist yet while most 
current CAPT programs followed a one-size-fits-all design due to factors such as disconnections between 
development and use, commercial motives for enhancing marketability, an overemphasis on technology, 
and a lack of an explicit pedagogical base. Many current CAPT programs continue to emphasize 
achievement of a native accent rather than intelligibility (Levis, 2005, 2007). These issues with CAPT 
programs are not new. Multiple authors (e.g., Derwing & Munro, 2009; Levis, 2005, 2007; Neri et al., 
2002; Thomson, 2012, 2013) have urged the design of innovative and pedagogically rigorous CAPT 
programs. In perception training, such an innovative model should be sensitive to learners’ L1s and 
diverse learner problems while reflecting research on L2 perception learning.

System Design 
In this article, we describe the design and evaluation of a prototype perceptual phonetic training system. 
Our system was designed according to the considerations suggested by research outlined above, which 
were translated into the following design principles. 
First, the segmentals in the system were selected with reference to the target participants’ L1 background 
(Nilsen & Nilsen, 2010; Swan & Smith, 2002), as well as Brown’s (1988) FL framework. Because a 
group of Russian EFL students had been selected as participants in the study prior to the design of the 
system, the segmental selections revolved around problematic sounds for native Russian speakers. Second, 
the words used for training were automatically controlled for frequency in general English data. 
Specifically, we ensured that our training stimuli were confined within the top 5,000 most frequent 
lemmata in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA), a 520-million-word online database 
of real-world language use (Davies, 2008). Third, our system automatically adapted to errors specific to 
each learner. Corresponding training exercises were automatically generated in order to target the 
learner’s problematic sounds. By allowing trainees to work on phonemic contrasts that they had difficulty 
perceiving, we hoped to ensure higher learning efficiency and promote learner autonomy and motivation. 
Our prototype system took the form of a web-based learning tool accessible via computers and hand-held 
electronic devices. The layout of the tool’s user interface (see Figure 1) was kept simple and self-
explanatory, with a working area on the left and a timer on the right. All test and training items were 
displayed one by one in the working area of the screen. Instructions for completing each item were 
provided in the green bar on the top. A choice of Don’t Know was made available for all the items 
through a  button in the upper-right corner. 
 
Figure 1. Interface of phonetic training system 
The system was designed to support four item types shown in Figure 2. All lexical and audio stimuli were 
presented as multiple-choice exercises created automatically by the system. The same types of items were 
utilized for both the training and the testing phases of the intervention, described below in more detail. 
The item types were (a) same–different discrimination (learners heard two words and needed to decide if 
they were the same or different), (b) oddity discrimination (learners heard three words and decided which 
one was the odd one out), (c) simple identification (learners heard a word and selected which one they 
heard from two options provided), and (d) yes/no identification (learners heard a word and needed to 
decide whether it matched the spelling provided). It should be noted that the latter two types of exercises 
suffered from a potential test design drawback in that they involved assessment of skills (recognition of 
lexical items and spellings) that were not explicitly trained in the study. To minimize the effect of this 
drawback, only high-frequency words were chosen as lexical stimuli in the study, assuming that learners 
tend to be more familiar with more frequently-occurring words.

Figure 2. The four item types used in the study were (a) same–different discrimination, (b) oddity 
discrimination, (c) simple identification, and (d) yes/no identification. 
Figure 3 illustrates the adaptive learning algorithm implemented in the system. When a learner first 
accessed the system, the training process began with the pre-test stage where the learner’s phonemic 
errors were diagnosed with a series of items. However, no evaluative feedback was provided at this time 
to limit learning at this stage. If the learner achieved 80% accuracy when completing the items on the pre-
test, the system would proceed to the next phonemic contrast. If the learner did not meet the 80% 
accuracy threshold, the system would automatically present the learner with a series of training exercises. 
At the training stage, participants were given immediate feedback on their performance for each training 
item as well as an answer key for the items that they had gotten wrong. The training was repeated until 
the accuracy of 80% was achieved, in which case a post-test immediately followed. 
Since the prototype of the system was designed for an EFL setting in Russia, 12 phonemic contrasts were 
selected for the study with two factors taken into consideration: (a) pronunciation errors typically shared 
by Russian speakers as documented in Nilsen and Nilsen (2010) and Swan and Smith (2002), and (b) the 
potential impact of a phonemic contrast on a speaker’s intelligibility as indicated in Brown’s (1988) table 
of FL values. Insights of two native-Russian teachers who were the English instructors of the participants 
in the study were also used as supplementary reference. The teachers were provided with a list of 
phonemic contrasts chosen as commonly conflated errors for Russian speakers and were asked which 
pairs they would recommend for inclusion in the training. They were also asked to suggest additional 
phonemic contrasts not on the given list. All the problem items mentioned in the literature were judged by 
the teachers as problematic, but several unlisted items were also proposed by the teachers such as /ɛ–ɪ/ 
and /ɔ–əʊ/, which indeed turned out to be difficult for some participants (for the number of participants 
who received training on each sound pair and the amount of training they received before passing training, 
see Table 7 and Table 8). The use of these resources ensured the selection was principled and improved 
the opportunity for the target participants to benefit from training on the selected phonemic contrasts. 
Appendix B provides a list of the selected 12 sound pairs in a descending order based on the sounds’ FL 
values.

Figure 3. Adaptive learning algorithm (PC = phonemic contrast) 
For each phonemic contrast, an array of seven minimal pairs was chosen for test and training stimuli. 
These minimal pairs were extracted from the Illinois Speech and Language Engineering Dictionary with 
word frequency and syllable environment controlled. We filtered the minimal-pair selection through the 
top 5,000 most frequently used lemmata in COCA to ensure that the selected minimal pairs were frequent 
and thus more likely to be familiar to learners in general. The decision to select seven minimal pairs for 
76 Language Learning & Technology 
 
each phonemic contrast was also based on the number of minimal pairs available in the COCA lemma list. 
The minimal pairs were randomly divided into three sets (see Appendix C); some were used during 
training and some not. Specifically, the participants were given training on the words in Set A and Set B, 
but not on the words in Set C, to examine whether the participants could transfer gains from trained to 
untrained words. In addition, different voices were used to create the audio for each word set: the voices 
for Set A and Set C were the same as the voices used for training, whereas Set B was recorded with 
voices that were new to the participants. The intention behind this setup was to examine whether the 
participants could extend changes in perceptual ability from familiar voices to new voices. 
Audio stimuli included recordings of all the selected minimal pairs listed in Appendix C. Four different 
voices were adopted for creating these stimuli, but only two voices were used for creating the stimuli used 
during training. The other two voices were reserved for test stimuli only. The two voices used for creating 
training stimuli included a female voice and a male voice and were generated using TTS, a technology 
that translates text automatically into soundwaves that represent speech (Delmonte, 2008). High-quality 
TTS was used in this study, provided by an industry partner indicated in the Acknowledgements section. 
The two natural voices used for recording Set B of the test stimuli were from two native speakers of 
standard North American English, one female and one male. The natural-voice stimuli were recorded with 
a digital voice recorder at a bit rate of 128 kbps and sampling frequency of 44.1kHz. 
System Evaluation 
The evaluation aspect of the study is situated within the framework proposed by Levis (2007), which 
highlights four criteria as guidance for assessing the effectiveness of CAPT applications. The criteria can 
be summarized as efficacy, transfer, retention, and spillover. This study focuses specifically on the first 
two criteria: (a) learner improvement on discriminating and identifying trained phonemes, and (b) learners’ 
transfer of perceptual gains to untrained contexts. The examination of transfer, defined as the application 
of previously acquired knowledge in one setting to a different setting (Gagne, Yekovich, & Yekovich, 
1993), is especially important because successful transfer is integral to robust learning (Logan & Pruitt, 
1995) and to the end goal that education should pursue (MacKeough, Lupart, & Marini, 1995). In this 
study, we addressed two levels of transferring phonemic perceptual skills: (a) transfer from known voices 
to new voices, and (b) transfer from trained words to new words. The motive for assessing the first level 
of transfer stemmed from the notion that speech variability tends to interfere with learners’ perception 
capacity; only when trainees are able to accurately perceive trained sounds articulated by unfamiliar 
voices can the training be regarded successful. The second level of transfer was inspected because the 
acoustic characteristics of a phoneme vary depending on the surrounding phonetic environments (Strange, 
Weber, Levy, Shafiro, & Nishi, 2002) and because the ability to perceive a phoneme in one phonetic 
context does not necessarily translate to other phonetic contexts (Thomson, 2012). In sum, the empirical 
research questions for this article are as follows: 
RQ1: How effective is the training design in improving perception of trained phonemes? 
RQ2: How well does the improvement generalize to untrained voices? 
RQ3: How well does the improvement generalize to novel words? 
Methodology 
Participants 
The study involved 32 native-Russian participants, 31 university-level students and one female English 
instructor aged 42. The 31 students included 9 females and 22 males between the ages of 20 and 23 (M = 
21.2 years), majoring in either marine engineering or English translation from two EFL schools in Russia. 
The training was self-paced and completed outside of class time. The participants were also in control of 
Manman Qian, Evgeny Chukharev-Hudilainen, and John Levis 77 
 
when and where to work on the phonetic exercises. Overall, the duration of the study for the participants 
ranged from 10 to 100 minutes, with the mean total time commitment per person being 70 minutes. The 
training content differed for each participant, since their phonemic problems varied in number. 
Pre-Test 
As illustrated in Figure 3, the participants were first given a pre-test for each sound pair. The pre-test 
consisted of four types of test items presented to the participants in the following order: (1) same–
different discrimination, (2) oddity discrimination, (3) simple identification, and (4) yes/no identification. 
As there were seven minimal pairs and four exercise types tied to each phonemic contrast, the total 
number of pre-test items per sound pair was 28. Among the items, eight audio files were by human 
speakers (for items in Set B) and the other 20 were by synthetic voices (for items in Sets A and C). 
Students scored 1 point for a correct response to a test item and 0 points for an incorrect or don’t know 
response. With an arbitrarily decided accuracy rate of 80% or better, students would be subsequently 
directed to the pre-test on a different sound pair. Otherwise, they would be provided with training on the 
problematic sounds. As a result, each student received training on only those sound pairs with which they 
demonstrated perception difficulties. 
Training 
Training for each phonemic contrast was provided to students in batches of exercises. The number of 
training exercises in each batch was five, with each exercise targeting a single minimal pair. Two out of 
seven minimal pairs per phonemic contrast were withheld from training (Appendix C) to later test for 
transfer to untrained items, and only one type of exercise was offered to a specific student for each 
phonemic contrast. The assignment of exercise type to phonemic contrast was randomized by the 
computer. Synthetic voices were used for all the training exercises given to the participants. The gender of 
the voice was also randomly selected by the computer for each exercise item. 
The quantity and length of training varied according to a student’s training performance, which was 
evaluated automatically at the end of each set of training. If the cutoff score (80%) was reached, trainees 
exited training on the phonemic contrast; if not, they would be given another set of training exercises on 
the same phonemic contrast with the type of exercise previously determined by the computer program. 
(Exercise type was controlled to examine its effect on training, but it is not reported in this article.) That is 
to say, the training duration not only varied by student but also by phonemic contrast for each student. 
Such a setup, compared with many previous HVPT studies where training duration was either completely 
subject-dominated (e.g., Wang & Munro, 2004) or researcher-dominated (e.g., all other HVPT studies), 
was more likely to utilize trainee’s time to the best advantage by focusing on the aspects that needed the 
most attention. On the other hand, as a by-product of this training model, there was a wide range of time 
on task, which added an extra independent variable that was not controlled for. The incorporation of 
immediate assessment also reduced the risk of having trainees rely on self-judgment to decide when to 
discontinue training. 
Although the exercise types and the word bank for generating exercises were the same for each 
participant, the training content presented to students in each round was still unlikely to be the same 
because the system retrieved word entries for each exercise independently and randomly. For each lexical 
unit shown on the screen, the system would first randomly select a word from the minimal pair and then 
randomly designate a female or male voice to go with the word. For instance, to generate a same–
different discrimination exercise for the word pair beat and bit, the system could produce any of the 16 
possibilities listed in Table 1. The motive for randomizing these selections was to make the training items 
diverse and less predictable as students looped through multiple training sets.

Students were given a post-test only on the phonemic contrasts they received training on. The post-test 
was the same as the pre-test and was administered by the training system automatically and immediately 
following a student’s completion of training on a sound pair. Post-tests included trained words with 
trained voices, trained words with untrained voices, and untrained words with trained voices. 
Data Analysis 
The data to answer the research questions included the participants’ scores on each pre- and post-test item. 
These scores were collected by the system in an automatic and de-identified manner along the 
participants' use of the system. As seen from the training algorithm (Figure 3), each participant received 
training that was tailored to his or her individual difficulties as assessed by the pre-test. As the 
participants received a pre-test score and a post-test score on each trained sound pair, the averages of the 
pre-test and post-test scores were used for data analysis. Table 2 shows the statistical approaches adopted 
for data analysis in response to each research question. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS. 
It should be noted that the scores used for analysis were normalized to the scale [0, 1].

Results 
RQ1. Training Effectiveness 
Participants’ pre-test and post-test scores, averaged across sound pairs on the 12 items in Set A (both 
words and voices trained), were compared to examine how the training facilitated the participant’s 
perceptual skills for discriminating and identifying trained words recorded with trained voices. Table 3 
lists the difference in each participant’s pre-post test scores. The difference was positive for a majority of 
the participants (19 out of 32), negative for 12 participants, and zero for one participant.

post-test scores (skewness = -0.01, SE = 0.41; kurtosis = 0.19, SE = 0.81) were close to a normal

performance on Set A before and after training. A significant difference was found in the scores for pre-

80 Language Learning & Technology 
 
the improvement was medium (Cohen’s d = .412), which, according to Coe’s (2002) effect-size-to-
percentile-interpretation table, means that the average trainee in the study would score higher than 66% of 
students who were initially equivalent but not trained. These results show a statistically significant 
improvement in the participants’ performance on all items in Set A from pre-test to post-test. This means 
that the training was effective in enhancing the participants’ ability to perceptually discriminate and 
identify the target phonemic contrasts from word pairs they had received training on. 
RQ2. Transfer to New Voices 
To find out whether the training promoted transfer of perceptual discrimination and identification abilities 
from trained voices to untrained voices, participants’ pre-test and post-test scores averaged across sound 
pairs on the eight items in Set B (trained words, new voices) were compared. Table 4 lists the difference 
between each participant’s pre-test and post-test scores on Set B. The difference was positive for a vast 
majority of the participants (23 out of 32), negative for three participants, and zero for the six others.

The participants’ average pre-test scores (skewness = 0.80, SE = 0.41; kurtosis = 2.59, SE = 0.81) and 
post-test scores (skewness = 0.13, SE = 0.41; kurtosis = -0.57, SE = 0.81) were approximate to normal 
distributions; a paired-samples t-test was conducted to statistically compare the participants’ test 
performance on Set B before and after training. A significant difference was found in the scores for pre-
test (M = 0.68, SD = 0.12) and post-test (M = .76, SD = 0.12), t(31) = -4.29, p = .000. The effect size of 
the score improvement ranged between medium and large (Cohen’s d = .624), which, if converted to 
percentiles (Coe, 2002), means that the average trainee in the study would now score higher than 73% of 
students who were initially equivalent but not trained. The statistically significant improvement in the 
participants’ performance suggests that the training successfully facilitated the participants to generalize 
perceptual gains from trained voices to untrained voices. 
To investigate whether the difference in gain scores between the two sets was statistically significant, a 
paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare each participant’s pre- and post-test improvement scores 
on Set A and Set B, both of which followed normal distribution. No significant difference was found in 
the gain scores between the two sets (Set A, M = 0.05, SD = 0.13; Set B, M = 0.08, SD = 0.10), t(31)= -
1.00, p = .326, Cohen’s d = .242. This suggests that the training facilitated similar perceptual acquisition 
of words spoken by trained voices and untrained voices. 
RQ3. Transfer to New Words 
To find out whether the training promoted transfer of perceptual discrimination and identification abilities 
from trained words to untrained words, participants’ pre-test and post-test scores averaged across sound 
pairs on the eight items in Set C (trained voices, new words) were compared. The participants’ average 
pre-test scores were close to normal distribution (skewness = 0.59, SE = 0.41; kurtosis = 0.61, SE = 0.81). 
The participants’ average post-test scores were normally distributed (skewness = 0.02, SE = 0.41; kurtosis 
= -0.28, SE = 0.81). Table 5 lists that approximately half of the participants (14 out of 32) had a positive 
gain score. A decrease in score from pre-test to post-test was seen with 10 participants; the scores stayed 
unchanged for eight participants.

A paired-samples t-test was conducted to statistically compare the participants’ test performance on Set C 
before and after training. No significant difference was found in the scores for pre-test (M = 0.66, SD = 
0.12) and post-test (M = 0.67, SD = 0.16), t(31) = -4.23, p = .675. The effect size was found to be very 
small (Cohen’s d = .076), indicating no difference between the two sets of scores. These results indicate 
that the training failed to facilitate the transfer of perceptual gains from trained to untrained words. 
Discussion 
Analyses of pre- and post-training data showed the efficacy of the training model in enhancing the 
participants’ perception of segmental contrasts. The participants were also able to generalize the 
perceptual improvement from words spoken with trained voices to the words spoken with untrained 
voices. Although the improvement was only medium level (Cohen’s d = .412 for Set A, Cohen’s d = .624 
for Set B), the training effect was practically important, considering that the training efforts were 
commensurate with learner achievement. The trainees’ entire time investment in the study, including 
involvement in the diagnostic and post-test, was only 70 minutes on average, shorter than two regular 
college-level class periods. In contrast, the pre- to post-test improvement, albeit moderate, can serve as 
evidence that the training was worthwhile. 
Changes in learner performance through training varied across subjects as demonstrated in Table 3, Table 
4, and Table 5, suggesting that the patterns of perceptual acquisition may be learner-specific. Further 
analyses of the participants’ performance revealed wide learner-level variation pertaining to training 
Manman Qian, Evgeny Chukharev-Hudilainen, and John Levis 83 
 
effect (Set A), transfer to voices (Set B), and transfer to words (Set C). For example, Table 6 displays 
each participant’s performance on test items in Set A (words trained, voices trained) on phonemic 
contrasts they received training on. Nine participants improved on all trained sound pairs, whereas nine 
others failed to improve on any of the trained sound pairs. Nevertheless, these patterns are not 
generalizable because the average number of trained phonemic contrasts was 3.13 (SD = 2.50), and 28% 
of the students (9 out of 32) received training on only one sound pair. Despite this, the drastic variations 
among trainees regarding their pre- to post-training gains might be evidence that perception learning is a 
unique process shaped by individual leaner characteristics. 
It should be noted that learners’ major of study was not investigated in the study due to a lack of access to 
the necessary demographic information, but analysis on this variable could be meaningful by revealing 
potential patterns among the individual-level variations. Assumptions are that English translation majors 
were more likely to improve than marine engineering students due to different levels of motivation.

In addition to inter-subject variation, the effect of training on the participants’ performance on trained 
items (Set A), untrained voices (Set B), and untrained words (Set C) also differed based on phonemic 
contrasts. Table 7 shows trainees’ performance on each phonemic contrast for test items in Set A (words 
trained, voices trained). The sound pairs exhibited different levels of acquisition difficulty. Trainees’ 
average pre- to post-training gains on the phonemic contrasts ranged from -0.04 (/ɛ–ɝ/) to 0.19 (/ɛ–ɪ/). For 
certain phonemic contrasts (i.e., /əʊ–ɝ/, /d–t/, /ɛ–ɪ/, /g–k/), all or most trainees showed improvement with 
nobody showing negative gain. However, for some other contrasts (i.e., /ɛ–ɝ/, /i–ɪ/, /æ–ʌ/, /æ–ɛ/), only a 
minority of trainees improved through training and the proportion of trainees with decreased post-test 
scores was relatively high. This may be an indicator that some phonemic contrasts are easier to acquire 
than others. However, this hypothesis should be examined in future research, because the number of 
trainees in the study for many of the sound pairs (e.g., /ɛ–ɝ/, /æ–ʌ/, /əʊ–ɝ/, and /g–k/) was small.

Putting together the analyses thus far, we can infer that phonetic acquisition is a process unique to each 
individual learner and shaped by the specific sounds being learned. Further evidence comes from an 
unclear correlation between the amount of training participants had received and the amount of gain they 
achieved through training. Table 8 lists the participant’s holistic gain scores on trained items based on a 
descending order of the number of training batches. The data show no obvious correlation between the 
two variables. In general, the phonemic contrasts on which participants were trained more intensely (e.g., 
/i–ɪ/) were not necessarily associated with higher gains, and vice versa (e.g., /ɛ–ɪ/). Table 9 displays the 
training quantity for students who did not improve on any sound pairs in contrast with students who 
consistently improved on all trained sound pairs. Again, no clear patterns were discovered between 
Manman Qian, Evgeny Chukharev-Hudilainen, and John Levis 85 
 
training amount and achievement. Students with one or multiple batches of training were seen in both 
categories. Learner achievement also exhibited variations even with the same amount of training on the 
same phonetic contrast, suggesting that phonetic acquisition is indeed learner-specific. For instance, one 
batch of training on /æ–ɛ/ led to improvement for St1, St3, St18, and St23, but not for St30. This was also 
a case with /i–ɪ/ for St10, St17, and St18. While the data do not show any generalizable pattern between 
training intensity and achievement, they do suggest that some students were faster than others in acquiring 
certain sounds. For example, for the contrast /æ–ɛ/, there were students (i.e., St1, St3, St18, St23, St25, 
St28) who improved after three or fewer training batches, but there were also students (i.e., St24, St32) 
who failed to improve after four or five batches.

No statistically significant effect was found in terms of the transfer of perceptual gains from trained words 
to untrained words, which echoes the widely accepted belief that L2 segmental acquisition can be highly 
sensitive to the linguistic context of a segment (Flege, 1995; Jamieson & Morosan, 1986; Munro et al., 
2015; Thomson, 2011, 2012) because the acoustic characteristics of a phoneme can be affected by its 
surrounding phonetic and lexical environments (Munro & Derwing, 2008; Pisoni & Lively, 1995; Walley 
& Flege, 1999). Possibly, the effect of lexicon on phonological acquisition observed in the study could be 
accounted for by three important and interrelated linguistic theories that predict language acquisition 
behavior: the exemplar theory (Bybee, 2000), the analogical modeling theory (Skousen, 1989), and the 
TRACE model of auditory word recognition within the connectionist framework (Joanisse & McClelland, 
2015). According to these theories, the categorization of novel linguistic stimuli occurs through 
comparisons of the stimuli with items already-stored in memory (as exemplars). While the first two 
theories relate to language learning in general, the TRACE model was proposed specifically for the 
decoding of speech input and is characterized by its dynamic and interactive nature in auditory language 
processing. The dynamism of the model posits that the acoustic input of a word is disassembled in a time-
varying manner into units that are subsequently interpreted in parallel (as opposed to serially; see 
Joanisse & McClelland, 2015). The interactivity of the model suggests that linguistic input is processed 
from dual directions, bottom-up and top-down, between words and phonemes—within the top-down 
dimension, the spoken input of a word can be stored as an entity or several major sub-entities rather than 
independent units divided at the level of phoneme. Specific to the participants’ experience in the study, 
their inability to generalize gains to novel words may be a result of the top-down effects in auditory input 
processing, since the trainees’ accumulation of perceptual representations of trained words could 
potentially be established from the unsegmented speech stream at the lexical or sub-lexical level. Such 
knowledge, after being stored in the memory, became what the participants would later refer to upon 
receiving auditory input of untrained words. However, because the new stimuli were environmentally and 
lexically different from the stored exemplars, the learners encountered difficulties recognizing the new 
items. 
The absence of phonological transfer at the word level may also be a sign that the training triggered only 
one of the two stages involved in language learning: item learning but not system learning. This two-stage 
distinction was initially made by Cruttenden (1981) to explain the developmental process of L1 learning 
and then extended to foreign language learning (Ellis, 1999; Ringbom, 1983). According to Cruttenden 
(1981), item learning, a prerequisite for system learning, “involves a form which is uniquely bonded with 
some other form or with a unique referent, whereas system-learning involves the possibility of the 
commutation of forms or referents while some (other) form is held constant” (p. 79). That is to say, most 
learners first learn items (e.g., words) as single entities by imitation and memory. Only later can they 
begin to realize that the items are in fact composed of discrete units which can be independently used with 
other units and form new items. Once learners build the capacity to decode the system of language, they 
are able to recognize (and perhaps produce) a linguistic unit despite potential apparent changes to its 
surroundings. In this study, the participants failed to discriminate and identify trained phonemic 
Manman Qian, Evgeny Chukharev-Hudilainen, and John Levis 87 
 
distinctions embedded in new words, meaning that the participants did not yet exhibit recognition of the 
contrasts in novel linguistic contexts. In order to facilitate the transition to the second stage of learning, 
two changes can potentially be implemented to the training model. One is to intensify the training with 
longer training batches and higher training accuracy thresholds. The second is to enrich the training 
stimuli by exposing learners to a greater variety of phonemic variations through more lexical stimuli, 
including ones of lower frequency. An intensified, enriched training model may promote transition, since 
continual exposure to and accumulation of a target item used in different situations are catalysts for the 
transition from item learning to system learning (Cruttenden, 1981). 
Perhaps some phonological guidance alongside phonetic training may also promote system learning by 
familiarizing learners with the certain predictable variability in the acoustic features of phonemes 
depending on contextual lexical variables. The provision of such guidance, ideally, should be based on L1 
customization and adapted to error profiles of individual learners. 
The generalization to new voices but not to new words raises the question of whether the acoustic 
properties of a phoneme are more easily modified by its linguistic environments than the inherent 
variability of multi-talker voices. The results also could be an indicator that the nature of the synthetic 
voices adopted in the study resembles human speech. While these inquiries can be pursued in the future, 
this study provides evidence that HVPT is effective for sharpening aural sensitivity to the variability in 
speaker voices and that TTS technology holds promise for being widely utilized for developing auditory 
materials for language learning. The efficacy of HVPT warns against the presently dominating 
pedagogical practices built on a single normative speech variety due to assumptions such as fear for 
learners’ comprehension, while lending significance to materials and tools that incorporate diverse 
speaker models. The potential of TTS technology to facilitate research and application of HVPT is also 
worth exploiting, as TTS is more cost-effective compared with human speech and allows for more 
efficient manipulation of variables such as speech rate and voice model, yielding a larger quantity and 
variety of speech output (Delmonte, 2008; Handley, 2009; Sha, 2010).  
Conclusion 
In this study, we experimented with providing perceptual training on 12 phonemic contrasts to a group of 
Russian-speaking English learners using a novel, prototype HVPT system. Our findings demonstrate that 
the prototype was effective in enhancing the learners’ perception of phonemic contrasts spoken by trained 
and untrained voices. The results lead us to believe that the prototype system, which is learner-oriented, 
flexible, efficient, varied in its input supply, and built to bridge research and practice, can be put forth as a 
perceptual training model for replication in language teaching and research settings. The ability of the 
system to allow individualization of high FL contrasts will improve learner efficiency in perceiving high-
value sounds and also have practical implications. For the many language teaching centers where limited 
in-class time is available for pronunciation instruction, the training system can be a substitute instructor 
for students who struggle with the identification of vowels and consonants. The development of the 
system’s capacities, an example of successful integration of technology into pronunciation instruction, 
also shows that pedagogy can be effectively enhanced by computational approaches. 
The current study can be extended in a few dimensions. For instance, the study did not explore whether 
the participants would be able to generalize their perceptual improvement beyond the level of isolated 
words, which is a critical criterion for evaluating any CAPT system, since the ultimate goal of perceptual 
training is to increase the ability to comprehend utterances. Long-term retention, proposed by Levis (2007) 
as an important criterion for evaluating CAPT systems, was not investigated in the study. Another area 
worthy of exploration is the potential spillover effects of the training model. In light of the promoting 
effect of segmental perceptual training on articulation of trained sounds (Bradlow et al., 1997; Lambacher 
et al., 2005; Thomson, 2011), a potential spillover effect of the training model that can be examined is its 
capacity to bring about gains on untrained skills, such as production of the trained phonemes. Apart from 
the quantitative measures of training effect, learner experience and attitudes are worth exploring because

they can further unfold the potentials and limitations of the system and inform future upgrades of the 
system. An upgraded system should be able to adapt not only to learners within one L1 but also to 
multiple L1s. A good way to realize this would be to develop the system with phonemic lists 
encompassing errors for a variety of L1s and later direct learners to different diagnostics based on their 
L1s. This adaptability at a broader level would ultimately give the system more practical significance, 
particularly in ESL contexts where learners generally come from mixed L1s. Last but not least, it should 
be noted that context, as a component integral to the ultimate goal of language acquisition, was 
completely missing from the current training. Balancing form against context has been a longstanding 
problem for pronunciation materials development. Minimal sentences (Bowen, 1972) were proposed as a 
technique to mitigate the lack of meaningfulness and context of word-level drills, but the construction of 
such sentences (and potentially other forms of materials that are beyond the single-word level and that 
highlight specific phonemic forms) has been limited by the availability of phonemic contrasts belonging 
to the same parts-of-speech category (Levis & Cortes, 2008). Future developers are encouraged to try 
embedding minimal sentences as much as possible to the system and to seek for potential alternatives to 
addressing the issue.

Notes 
1. Phonetic context was not controlled for in testing and training materials development. We assumed 
the inclusion of multiple phonetic contexts was a characteristic for high-variability input treatment 
and thus a natural part of the treatment the participants received.

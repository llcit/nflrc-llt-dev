Special Issue: Using Corpora in Language Teaching and Learning 
Guest Editors: Chris Tribble and Michael Barlow 
This special issue of Language Learning & Technology will focus on all aspects of using 
computer held text corpora in language learning and teaching. 
As the availability of computing resources and electronically stored text data has increased, 
access to corpora has ceased to be the sole prerogative of lexicographers and university 
researchers. This has meant that corpus-informed approaches to language learning, however 
interpreted, are becoming more common, and that there is a growing interest in, and need for, 
information about ways of working with corpus data. 
We welcome articles that report on original empirical research in this area, or that address issues 
in the theory and practice of implementing corpus-informed approaches to language learning and 
teaching. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to 
 Issues in corpus design, especially in relation to appropriate models for foreign language
learning
 Issues in coding/tagging corpora and the potential of marked-up corpora in language
education
 Using corpora linked to speech and/or video
 Discussions of corpus informed teaching programs and materials development
 Discussions of specific methodologies for incorporating corpora into classroom teaching
 Accounts of specific corpus analysis tools relevant to language teaching
 Discussions of the role of corpora in specific purpose teaching
 Learner corpora
 Corpora in translation studies (including parallel aligned corpora)

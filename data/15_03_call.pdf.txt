Call for Papers for Special Issue of LLT 
 
Theme: Mobile Language Learning 
 
Special Issue Editors: Glenn Stockwell & Susana Sotillo 
 
There has been increased interest in portable technologies which allow learners to access tools for 
learning languages in virtually any time or place that suits them. The quickly developing functionalities of 
mobile phones, MP3 players, laptop and tablet computers, and other hand-held devices with touch screen 
technology mean that the range of possibilities for language learning has greatly diversified. Godwin-
Jones (2011), for example, points out that iPhone and Android phones have ushered in a phenomenal 
expansion in the development of Apps for just about every topic under the sun, and educators have been 
exploring the value of Apps for learning specific skills (e.g., math, geometry) and language since 
2009. The interest in such mobile technologies for learning languages has also been reflected in recent 
literature, with the appearance of studies using mobile technologies, such as podcasts (e.g., Rosell-
Aguilar, 2006), short message service (SMS) (e.g., Levy & Kennedy, 2008; Sotillo, 2010; Thurlow, 2003, 
2009), and mobile phones (Stockwell, 2010), to name a few. This special issue of Language Learning & 
Technology seeks to provide a variety of perspectives on learning through mobile technologies, with a 
particular focus on corpus-based or empirical studies investigating how the use of these technologies 
affect and are affected by the language learning environment, or discussions of theoretical issues 
associated with learning through mobile technologies.  
 
Please consult the LLT Website for general guidelines on submission (http://llt.msu.edu/contrib.html) and 
research (http://llt.msu.edu/resguide.html) and note that articles containing only descriptions of 
software or pedagogical procedures without presenting in-depth empirical data and analysis on 
language learning processes or outcomes will not be considered.  
Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 
• Practical issues of mobile language learning 
• Theories applicable to mobile language learning 
• Autonomy and/or self-directed learning through mobile technologies 
• Teacher education for mobile language learning 
• Development of Apps and software for mobile language learning 
• Using mobile technologies for specialized language learning 
• Teaching second language pragmatics through mobile technologies

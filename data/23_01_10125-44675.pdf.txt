Abstract 
While research on informal digital learning of English (IDLE) increases in the fields of teaching English 
to speakers of other languages and computer-assisted language learning, few studies have examined the 
relationship between quantity and diversity of IDLE practices and different language learning outcomes. 
To address this gap, data were collected through one questionnaire, six English learning outcomes, and a 
semi-structured interview from 71 Korean English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) university students. 
Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that IDLE Quantity, Age, and Major were significant 
predictors of two affective variables (Confidence and Enjoyment), while IDLE Diversity and Major were 
significantly predictive of productive language outcomes (Speaking and Productive Vocabulary 
Knowledge), scores in a standardized English test (TOEIC), and one affective variable (Lack of Anxiety). 
These results revealed how IDLE quantity and diversity can make a unique contribution to EFL learners’ 
English outcomes.

Introduction 
With the development of digital technologies and Web 2.0, second language (L2) affordance and 
opportunities have expanded beyond the classroom (Reinders & Benson, 2017). With a changing 
environment of L2 learning and teaching, as well as its improved potential for out-of-class L2 learning, an 
increasing number of researchers and practitioners in the fields of teaching English to speakers of other 
languages (TESOL) and computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has become interested in informal 
digital learning of English (IDLE) in various English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts1 (Chik & Ho, 
2017; Lai, 2017; Sundqvist & Sylvén, 2016; Richards, 2015). 
Many previous studies have discussed quantity of EFL learners’ IDLE activities in relation to English 
learning outcomes, such as vocabulary knowledge, reading and listening, and school grades (Jensen, 
2017; Sundqvist & Wikström, 2015). Other studies of IDLE (e.g., Olsson & Sylvén, 2015) have reported 
mixed evidence for benefits of IDLE quantity, and some recent studies (e.g., Lai, Zhu, & Gong, 2015; Lee 
& Dressman, 2018) have called for attention to the diversity of IDLE activities that are conducive to 
achieving English learning outcomes, such as confidence, productive vocabulary knowledge, speaking, 
and scores on formal testing. 
To date, however, it is still inconclusive whether or to what extent the quantity and diversity of IDLE 
activities used by EFL students relate to English learning outcomes. Therefore, this study attempts to 
explore this less charted terrain with the goal of advancing our understanding of quantity and diversity of 
IDLE activities in relation to English learning outcomes. The results of this study offer novel insights into 
this research issue and help educational stakeholders (e.g., institutions and teachers) make an informed

Literature Review 
Informal Digital Learning of English 
With the advancement of digital technologies and their potential for out-of-class L2 learning, an 
increasing number of TESOL and CALL researchers and practitioners have become interested in IDLE-
oriented topics in various EFL contexts: for example, in Denmark (Jensen, 2017), Sweden (Sundqvist, 
2009; Sundqvist & Sylvén, 2014; Sundqvist & Wikström, 2015), France (Sockett, 2013, 2014; Sockett & 
Toffoli, 2012), Morocco (Dressman, Lee, & Sabaoui, 2016), Russia (Kozar & Sweller, 2014), Malaysia 
(Tan, Ng, & Saw, 2010), India (Mitra, Tooley, Inamdar, & Dixon, 2003), China (Chen, 2013; Lai et al., 
2015; Sun, Franklin, & Gao, 2017), South Korea (Lee, 2017), Japan (Casanave, 2012), and Brazil (Cole 
& Vanderplank, 2016). 
Given the growing interest in understanding language learning in out-of-class CALL settings (i.e., IDLE), 
Benson (2011) proposed four dimensions of out-of-class L2 learning in terms of formality (whether 
language learning experience is formally structured and certificate is granted: e.g., formal, non-formal, or 
informal), location (where language learning occurs physically: e.g., in-class, out-of-class, 
extracurricular, and extramural), pedagogy (to what degree formal language learning processes are 
involved: e.g., instructed, self-instructed, and naturalistic), and locus of control (to what extent language 
learners take control of their own learning; e.g.: self-directed or other-directed). Although Benson himself 
has admitted that this is “a somewhat rudimentary framework” (p. 15), this conceptualization nevertheless 
helps us understand English learning in diverse IDLE contexts (Chik, 2014).

As summarized in Table 1, we can conceptualize IDLE based on Benson’s (2011) four dimensions (see 
also Reinders & Benson, 2017). In this study, digital refers to both digital devices (e.g., smartphones, 
tablets, personal computers, laptops, etc.) and resources (e.g., MP3s, web apps, social media, YouTube, 
etc.). Additionally, certification refers to a document that verifies a person’s competence or to an official 
qualification that is granted by an accredited or authorized individual or agency. More importantly, a 
certification should also be recognized by other agencies or employers. For example, undergraduate 
students receive a certification granted by a government or other accreditation body for the completion of 
their educational program. Moreover, such a certification is also recognized (and accepted) by other 
educational institutions. Therefore, a certification that is issued by Coursera but not recognized by another 
formal agency is not valid in this study. 
IDLE in extracurricular contexts is self-directed, self-instructed, digital learning of English in semi-
structured, out-of-class environments that are still linked to a formal language program. For example, 
students take primary responsibility for completing homework or group projects through self-instruction 
(e.g., referring to Wikipedia articles or watching YouTube tutorials to get their homework done) outside 
of the classroom. However, the course is still partially structured by teachers (i.e., semi-structured) who 
116 Language Learning & Technology 
 
assess students’ performance. In contrast, IDLE in extramural contexts is self-directed, naturalistic, digital 
learning of English in unstructured, out-of-class environments, independent of a formal language 
program. For example, students, on their own initiative, could chat casually with other English users on 
Facebook for socializing. However, if that chatting is part of school assignments in out-of-class CALL 
environments, it is considered to be IDLE in and extracurricular context, because the activity is structured 
and evaluated by the teacher. This study adopts IDLE in extramural contexts as a guiding principle for 
exploring the research questions (RQs). 
Quantity Versus Diversity of IDLE 
Although research on IDLE is still in the early stages, current studies seem to report mixed findings 
regarding the impacts of IDLE on L2 learning. Burston (2014, 2015) and Sung, Chang, and Yang (2015) 
have suggested that mobile learning in informal contexts (e.g., outdoors) may not have substantially better 
effects on listening and reading skills than learning in formal contexts (e.g., traditional classroom). In 
particular, meta-analysis studies (Sung et al., 2015; Sung, Chang, & Liu, 2016) have provided evidence 
that mobile learning lasting less than one week usually did not produce a significant effect on language 
skills. 
Conversely, other studies have reported a positive correlation between L2 learning outcomes and IDLE 
quantity and diversity. During the past decade, several studies have reported a positive relationship 
between quantity of IDLE activities and L2 learning outcomes such as vocabulary knowledge, reading 
and listening, and school grades (Jensen, 2017; Olsson, 2011; Sundqvist, 2009; Sundqvist & Sylvén, 
2014; Sundqvist & Wikström, 2015; Sylvén & Sundqvist, 2012). These studies have consistently 
suggested that frequent engagement with IDLE activities (e.g., digital games) is positively correlated with 
L2 learning outcomes among young EFL learners in Nordic regions. These findings indicate that EFL 
learners can develop and acquire English knowledge through massive exposure to English as well as 
interaction with other English users in various IDLE contexts. 
Mixed findings for IDLE quantity have been provided recently (e.g., Olsson & Sylvén, 2015), reporting 
that the quantity of IDLE did not produce the same effect among students in different grade levels in 
relation to English vocabulary knowledge. Other recent studies (e.g., Lai et al., 2015; Lee, 2017; Lee & 
Dressman, 2018) have emphasized the importance of diversity of IDLE activities. For example, Lee 
(2017) and Lee and Dressman (2018) showed that EFL students who involve themselves in diverse IDLE 
activities and who strike a balance between form- and meaning-focused activities can create a healthy 
IDLE ecology that leads to positive language learning outcomes. These studies found that varied types of 
IDLE activities can enhance affective variables (lack of anxiety and confidence), productive language 
outcomes (speaking and productive vocabulary knowledge), and scores in standardized English tests 
(TOEIC). 
Despite the growing literature in IDLE, it is still inconclusive whether or to what extent the quantity and 
diversity of IDLE activities are linked with English learning outcomes among EFL students. Therefore, 
this study attempts to unravel the relationship between quantity and diversity of IDLE practices and six 
different English learning outcomes, guided by the following RQs: 
1. Is the quantity of IDLE associated with English learning outcomes? 
2. Is the diversity of IDLE activities associated with English learning outcomes? 
Methodology 
Settings and Participants 
This study is part of a larger research project that investigates IDLE practices among Korean EFL 
university students. Originally, data were generated from a total of 317 Korean undergraduate students 
from three separate universities, named here with the pseudonyms Korea Western University (KWU), 
Korea Eastern University (KEU), and Korea Central University (KCU). A survey instrument was 
Ju Seong Lee 117 
 
distributed in the middle of the Fall 2016 semester, followed by semi-structured interviews (N = 94). 
Permission to collect data was obtained from the three educational institutions, nine instructors, and each 
of the survey participants. 
Previous studies (Kang, 2014; Yang & Kim, 2011) have reported that overseas experiences could 
significantly influence Korean English learners’ L2 state of anxiety and English abilities. Therefore, the 
present study only included students who have not lived or studied abroad in order to reduce any potential 
confounding variable. Hence, this study drew only on data from 71 Korean EFL learners who lacked any 
overseas experience from KWU (n = 33, 46.5%), KEU (n = 25, 35.2%), and KCU (n = 13, 18.3%). Their 
average age was 21.55, with ages ranging from 19 to 26. They consisted of first-year (n = 25, 35.2%), 
second-year (n = 28, 39.4%), third-year (n = 10, 14.1%), and fourth-year (n = 8, 11.3%) students, both 
male (n = 24, 33.8%) and female (n = 47, 66.2%). These students constituted a mix of various majors 
such as English education (n = 20, 28.2%), English literature (n = 14, 19.7%), the humanities (n = 19, 
26.8%), engineering (n = 10, 14.1%), and others (n = 8, 11.3%). Most participants (n = 64, 90.2%) had 
been studying English for more than six years at the time of data collection. 
Instruments and Data Collection 
One questionnaire, six English learning outcomes, and semi-structured interviews were used for data 
collection. 
Questionnaire 
During the Fall 2016 semester, the investigator explained the nature of the study (e.g., goals, procedures, 
benefits, data security) and distributed the consent letters and questionnaires to students in their 
classrooms. A questionnaire consisting of three parts was designed to elicit students’ demographic 
information, English learning outcomes, and quantity of IDLE activities. During the pilot stage, a group 
of SLA researchers judged the content validity of the questionnaire and offered suggestions to improve it. 
The original English questionnaire items were also translated into Korean for Korean respondents and 
checked for the instruments’ clarity and precision using both forward- and backward-translations. 
Specifically, the first part (demographic information) asked questions concerning participants’ individual 
backgrounds such as school, grade, gender, major, overseas experiences, and length of time studying 
English. 
The second part (English outcomes) was designed to obtain students’ psychological aspects of English 
levels (confidence, enjoyment, and anxiety) and standardized English ability (TOEIC score). The students 
answered a confidence item (I feel confident in using English well), enjoyment (I enjoy learning English), 
and anxiety (I feel nervous about communicating in English) using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 
(very weak) to 5 (very strong). Although each psychological construct was assessed with a single-item 
questionnaire (e.g., Lai et al., 2015), a semi-structured interview provided much more detail about their 
interpretations of each construct. As for standardized English ability, students were instructed to provide 
TOEIC scores from tests taken within the past two years, as the validity of a TOEIC test score only lasts 
for two years (Educational Testing Service, 2017). Since it was possible to give inaccurate numbers 
because of memory constraints or dishonesty, the scores were checked again during the interview. 
For the third part (quantity of IDLE activities), participants answered an open-ended question item, (On 
average, how many hours each day did you spend in engaging in IDLE activities outside the classroom in 
the past 6 months?) that was modified from the study by Lai et al. (2015). The concept of IDLE might 
have been vague for some participants. Therefore, prior to the survey, participants were explicitly 
instructed to refer to the term IDLE as IDLE in extramural contexts and provided various examples to 
avoid different interpretations. 
English Learning Outcomes 
To determine the English learning outcomes, students’ psychological aspects of English levels 
(Confidence, Enjoyment, and Anxiety), standardized English ability (TOEIC Score), and productive 
118 Language Learning & Technology 
 
language outcomes (Speaking and Vocabulary) were assessed, allowing for a more holistic understanding 
of students’ language abilities. Data regarding confidence, enjoyment, anxiety, and TOEIC score were 
obtained from questionnaires. As for speaking, the investigator administered 5-minute English oral tests 
to each of the participants. Just like the IELTS speaking test, the test was interactive. After being 
informed of the purpose, instruction, and total duration of the test, the participants were asked to speak 
about their own personal opinions and recollections on topics such as hobbies, food, and motivation to 
learn English (e.g., Tell me about one of your hobbies. or What is your motivation for learning English?). 
The students’ responses were recorded for a later rating. Three English raters (one certified rater and two 
experienced English teachers) were recruited to evaluate all speaking samples based on modified TOEFL 
Speaking Rubrics. There was a brief training session (e.g., a practiced scoring meeting and a check for 
internal reliability) before the actual evaluation. Inter-rater reliability for English speaking was assessed 
using the intraclass correlation coefficient, which resulted in a score of .83 (p < .001), showing a high 
level of inter-rater reliability among raters (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979). 
The productive vocabulary levels test (PVLT) was used to determine students’ vocabulary outcomes and 
was also used for one of the productive language outcomes. Laufer and Nation (1999) developed this 
instrument, which has become one of the most reliable, validated, and widely used vocabulary tests in 
studies on IDLE (Sundqvist, 2009; Sundqvist & Wikström, 2015; Sylvén & Sundqvist, 2012). Park 
(2012) found that there was a significant relationship between PVLT scores and one variable (Writing 
Proficiency) of Korean EFL university students’ productive language, although such a relationship could 
differ depending on word frequency levels. The PVLT contained 18 questions, which was similar to the 
C-test, with some initial or terminal letters deleted. Students filled in each blank with the correct letters 
based on the prompt and a contextual sentence. For example, when students encountered the sentence 
“Governments often cut budgets in times of financial cri___”, they could enter “sis” in the blank, forming 
the word crisis. It was easy to administer because students completed the test within 10 minutes, using 
their own digital devices in the classroom. The test score, which was automatically viewed upon 
submission, was reported on the questionnaire under the supervision of the investigator and instructors. 
Semi-Structured Interview 
The investigator conducted a semi-structured interview with each student (n = 71) who had submitted the 
signed consent form and completed the questionnaire. The purposes of the interview were (a) to verify 
students’ quantitative responses (e.g., TOEIC scores, psychological aspects of English levels, and 
frequency of IDLE activities), (b) to obtain a deeper understanding of their questionnaire responses, and 
(c) to elicit the diversity of their IDLE activities (for question items, see Appendix). Each interview was 
conducted in Korean extramurally for 30–60 minutes. 
Data Analysis 
During the data exploration phase, it was found that eight students did not take a vocabulary test, so there 
were eight missing values for the PVLT (11.3%). In order to improve statistical power, Little’s MCAR 
test was first conducted to investigate whether the values missing were random. The results (χ2 = 4.01; df 
= 5; p = .550) indicated that the missing values occurred entirely at random. Then, the expectation-
maximization technique was undertaken to replace missing values with imputed values (Dempster, Laird, 
& Rubin, 1977). 
To answer RQ1, a Pearson correlation was carried out to analyze the relationship between IDLE quantity 
and the six English learning outcomes. For the RQ2, the conceptualization of diversity-learning 
experiences used in the study by Lai et al. (2015) was adopted and modified as an appropriate analytic 
framework to analyze the diversity of IDLE activities. Lai et al. defined this concept as “activities 
that...struck a balance between focus on form and focus on meaning in the holistic learning experience” 
(p. 286). At the outset, the investigator transcribed, sorted, coded, and synthesized the interview data. 
Then, form-focused IDLE (FFI) and meaning-focused IDLE (MFI) activities were counted, respectively, 
for compiling IDLE diversity. Specifically, FFI referred to an activity with more attention given to 
Ju Seong Lee 119 
 
learning or memorizing linguistic forms and structures in IDLE environments, while MFI referred to an 
activity with more focus on comprehending and using English in IDLE contexts. The participants of this 
study practiced FFI activities such as looking up vocabulary in an online dictionary and checking 
grammar using Google Translate. MFI activities included watching entertainment programs (e.g., dramas, 
movies, or talk shows), using social media (e.g., Facebook, KaKaoTalk, Skype), and talking to others 
while playing massively multiplayer online role-playing games. Subsequently, the diversity of IDLE was 
calculated by summing up both FFI and MFI activities. Since using Google Translate or chatting with 
other English users on Facebook could be both FFI and MFI activities, the final decisions were made 
based on individuals’ perceptions and intentions identified during the interviews. Further, more effort was 
made to distinguish between diversity and pseudo-diversity of IDLE. For instance, if a student were 
involved in an optimal diversity of IDLE experiences (e.g., by striking a balance in both FFI [n = 7] and 
MFI [n = 9]), it was regarded as diversity of IDLE. In contrast, if the value of IDLE activities was 10, yet 
only involved 10 different FFI activities exclusively, it was regarded as pseudo-diversity of IDLE; such 
cases would not truly manifest the diversity of IDLE experiences. Then, a Pearson correlation was carried 
out to examine the relationship between IDLE diversity and English outcomes. 
To determine which variables would predict six different English learning outcomes, hierarchical linear 
regression analyses were performed. Tests to check whether the data met the assumption of collinearity 
demonstrated that multicollinearity was not a concern (Speaking: Tolerance = .63, VIF = 1.60; PVLT 
Score: Tolerance = .43, VIF = 2.31; TOEIC Score: Tolerance = .53, VIF = 1.91; Confidence: Tolerance 
= .36, VIF = 2.78; Enjoyment: Tolerance = .35, VIF = 2.84; Anxiety: Tolerance = .77, VIF = 1.29). IDLE 
quantity and diversity were entered in Step 2 after controlling for the four demographic characteristics 
(i.e., Age, Gender, Length of Time Studying English, and Major) entered in Step 1. Finally, member 
checking was also carried out via email correspondence and individual interviews by debriefing and 
sharing preliminary results from the analysis (LeCompte, 2000; also see Birt, Scott, Cavers, Campbell, & 
Walter, 2016). 
Results 
According to the quantity of IDLE experiences, 62.0% (n = 44) of the students spent less than one hour 
on IDLE practices on a daily basis, followed by 22.5% (n = 16) who spent between one and two hours, 
and 15.5% (n = 11) who spent more than two hours. Table 2 shows the descriptive information on the 
diversity of participants’ IDLE practices. Overall, the students involved about eight different IDLE 
activities that combined FFI and MFI activities.

Table 3 shows participants’ descriptive data on English learning outcomes such as psychological aspects 
of English levels (Confidence, Enjoyment, and Anxiety), productive language outcomes (Speaking and

gave somewhat positive ratings for Confidence (M = 3.01, SD = 1.12), Enjoyment (M = 3.41, SD = 1.20) 
and Anxiety (M = 3.18, SD = 1.09), as all the mean scores were higher than 3 (out of the 5-point Likert 
scale). There were wide distributions among students across TOEIC scores (M = 679.15 SD = 193.60, 
ranging from 200 to 980), Speaking (M = 74.03, SD = 12.05, ranging from 55 to 100), and PVLT Score 
(M = 36.29, SD = 21.37, ranging from 8 to 88).

Quantity of IDLE and English Learning Outcomes 
Based on the results of the correlation analysis (Table 4), the quantity of IDLE was significantly 
correlated with Confidence (r = .35, p < .01) and Enjoyment (r = .39, p < .01), but not with the other 
indicators of language outcomes. This suggests that the quantity of IDLE is significantly associated with 
two domains of affective variables (Confidence and Enjoyment), but not with productive language 
outcomes (Speaking and PVLT Score), scores on standardized tests (TOEIC), or Anxiety.

Diversity of IDLE and English Learning Outcomes 
Correlation analysis (Table 5) indicated that the diversity of IDLE activities correlated significantly with 
Confidence (r = .34, p < .01), Speaking (r = .56, p < .01), PVLT Score (r = .54, p < .01), and TOEIC 
Score (r = .47, p < .01). In particular, there was a high strength of correlation between IDLE diversity and 
productive language variables such as Speaking and PVLT Score. This finding suggests that the diversity 
of IDLE activities was more positively associated with productive language outcomes than the other 
aspects of English learning outcomes.

Regression Analyses 
Table 6 shows the results of the hierarchical regression analyses to predict six English learning outcomes 
(Confidence, Enjoyment, Anxiety, Speaking, PVLT Score, and TOEIC Score) from IDLE quantity and 
diversity after controlling the potential influence of the demographic variables (Gender, Age, Length of 
Time Studying English, and Major). As a result, six different regression models were yielded. 
The first model, which explained 24% of the variance (F(6, 64) = 4.69, p < .01), showed that IDLE quantity 
(Β = .23), Age (Β = -.30), and Major (Β = -.26) were significant predictors of Confidence. The second 
model, which accounted for 30% of the variance (F(6, 64) = 5.88, p < .01), revealed that IDLE quantity (Β 
= .27), Age (Β = -.24), and Major (Β = -.35) were also significant predictors of Enjoyment. The third 
model, which explained 19% of the variance (F(6, 64) = 2.52, p < .05), showed that only IDLE diversity (Β 
= -.28) was a significant predictor of Anxiety. 
The fourth model, which explained 42% of the variance (F(6, 64) = 9.36, p < .01), demonstrated that IDLE 
diversity (Β = .28) and Major (Β = -.45) were significant predictors of TOEIC Score. The fifth model, 
which accounted for 48% of the variance (F(6, 64) = 11.95, p < .01), showed that IDLE diversity (Β = .38), 
Length of Time Studying English (Β = .32), and Major (Β = -.30) were identified as significant predictors 
of Speaking. The last model, which explained 48% of the variance (F(6, 64) = 11.90, p < .01), showed that 
IDLE diversity (Β = 0.37) and Major (Β = -.50) were significant predictors of PVLT Score.

Discussion 
This study set out to investigate whether the quantity and diversity of IDLE activities were associated 
with English learning outcomes among Korean EFL university students. Two major findings were 
identified. First, IDLE quantity, Age, and Major were significant predictors for Confidence and 
Enjoyment. This indicates that EFL students who were younger, majored in English, and engaged more 
frequently in IDLE activities had higher level of L2 confidence and enjoyment than those who were older, 
majored in non-English disciplines, and participated in IDLE activities less frequently. 
Interestingly, the quantity of IDLE was positively associated with two aspects of affective domains 
(Confidence and Enjoyment), but not with Speaking or PVLT Score. Two insights can be drawn from 
this. First, there is a positive relationship between the quantity of IDLE and Confidence and Enjoyment. 
This result is consistent with previous studies that have reported on the affective benefits of digital games 
(Reinders & Wattana, 2014, 2015; Thorne, Black, & Sykes, 2009). On these grounds, it can be implied 
that IDLE quantity may help Korean EFL learners emotionally. For example, they may enjoy learning 
122 Language Learning & Technology 
 
English more and feel more confident using English. However, correlation is not causation. It could be 
that EFL students who enjoy learning English and feel confident about communicating in English spend 
more time involved in IDLE activities. Thus, other studies may be required to substantiate this claim. In 
addition, there is no meaningful relationship between the quantity of IDLE and productive language 
outcomes. This finding is not consistent with previous research (Jensen, 2017; Olsson, 2011; Sundqvist & 
Sylvén, 2014; Sundqvist & Wikström, 2015; Sylvén & Sundqvist, 2012) reporting on the correlation 
between IDLE quantity (e.g., Gaming Play) and English learning outcomes (e.g., PVLT Score). This 
finding may imply that the IDLE quantity may produce different learning outcomes depending on 
students’ learning contexts (e.g., Korean EFL context and Nordic EFL contexts)—another implication 
that would merit further investigation. 
The second significant finding was that IDLE diversity and Major were significantly predictive of 
productive language outcomes (Speaking and PVLT Score), a standardized English test (TOEIC Score), 
and one affective variable (Anxiety). This indicates that IDLE activities can have a significant real-world 
impact on the speaking, productive vocabulary knowledge, TOEIC scores, and anxiety levels of EFL 
students, particularly English majors who engage in various types of IDLE activities. This result 
concurred with previous studies that EFL students who put themselves in an “invisible university of rich 
and authentic multimodal resources” (Lee & Dressman, 2018, p. 443) and facilitated their L2 learning 
without formal assistance from teachers tended to have high levels of communicative skills. This result 
also corroborates the study by Lai et al. (2015), in which the diversity of EFL learners’ out-of-class 
learning had a positive relationship with affective learning (e.g., learning efficacy) and English grades. 
However, the present study offers new insights into how the diversity of IDLE activities engaged in by 
Korean EFL learners without any overseas experience is significantly linked with other affective domains 
(Anxiety), productive language outcomes (Speaking and PVLT Score) and scores on standardized English 
tests (TOEIC Score). Based on these results, it seems plausible that EFL students who have not studied or 
traveled abroad but developed or implemented a balance in both FFI and MFI activities could reduce a 
sense of L2 anxiety and enhance their productive English outcomes such as speaking and productive 
vocabulary knowledge. Still, substantiating this interpretation requires additional empirical research. 
Regarding the positive relationship with TOEIC scores, the participants were educated in a Korean 
educational context that placed greater emphasis on high-stakes English tests such as the college entrance 
exam and the TOEIC (Choi, 2008). In that regard, the present findings, with respect to such associations 
with TOEIC scores, may have yielded a meaningful result. 
Conclusion 
The present study offers empirical evidence that provides a better understanding of IDLE activities among 
Korean EFL university students. Specifically, this study investigated how the quantity and diversity of 
IDLE activities were associated with English learning outcomes. The results of this study offer new 
insights into how IDLE quantity and diversity can make a unique contribution to EFL learners’ English 
outcomes and determine how educational stakeholders such as institutions, teachers, and parents can help. 
For example, it is of paramount importance for educational stakeholders to recognize that quantity and 
diversity of IDLE activities should not be regarded as synonymous (Lee, 2017). Stakeholders should be 
cautious about concluding that learners spending massive amounts of time playing online games or 
chatting with others on Facebook using an L2 result in affective learning or assuming that frequent 
engagement in IDLE activities can be conducive to achieving L2 outcomes. Rather, it is important for 
stakeholders to help L2 learners make informed decisions about which digital devices and resources they 
should use, how much time they should spend on IDLE activities, and which types of IDLE activities they 
should engage in. 
This study has a few drawbacks. First, there were a number of different IDLE activities with which EFL 
students engaged. Due to page constraints, the researcher could not provide qualitative findings 
illustrating how the students practiced various IDLE activities (e.g., social networking sites, fandoms, 
Ju Seong Lee 123 
 
massive open online courses). Future research will focus more on what is actually happening in the digital 
wilds and provide more qualitative aspects of IDLE activities used by Korean EFL learners. Second, 
students’ psychological aspects of English levels (Confidence, Enjoyment, and Anxiety) were obtained 
through single-item measures. For better comprehension of this phenomenon, more fine-tuned 
instruments must be used to measure English learning outcomes in future studies. Third, the finding 
regarding an association between the quantity of IDLE and productive language outcomes seemed to be 
different from the results that had been previously reported in Nordic regions. This suggests that 
culturally situated IDLE practices may produce different learning outcomes. In that regard, a cross-
cultural comparative study about IDLE practice may merit future research attention. It would be worth 
investigating how different sociocultural and educational contexts (e.g., Korea and Sweden) might play a 
role in influencing learners’ perception and practice of IDLE activities that are associated with learning 
outcomes (e.g., productive vocabulary knowledge and speaking). Lastly, in order to help us to empirically 
substantiate claims about the effect of IDLE activities on L2 learning, an intervention study could be 
designed and implemented. That is, in the control group, teachers could conduct general language 
learning in the classroom (a non-IDLE environment). In Experimental Group A, a researcher could 
include a group of students that engage in IDLE quantity activities, and in Experiment Group B, groups of 
students who participate in IDLE diversity activities could be included. It would be of interest to examine 
whether this approach could be effective in developing students’ L2 learning attitudes, behaviors, and 
learning outcomes.

1. The terms extramural English (Sundqvist, 2009), online informal learning of English (Sockett, 2014), 
out-of-class English learning (Lai et al., 2015), and language learning and teaching beyond the 
classroom (Reinders & Benson, 2017) may seem different, but in this study, they are not considered 
mutually exclusive, as these notions share much in common when regarding their perspectives and 
principles.

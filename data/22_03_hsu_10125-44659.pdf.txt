Abstract 
This study investigated the effect of wiki-mediated collaborative writing on the development of learners’ 
individual writing in a second language (L2). Participants were 52 learners of English as a foreign 
language enrolled in two intact junior writing classes at a Taiwanese university. One class was assigned 
to be a wiki-collaborative writing group (n = 26), and the other an individual writing group (n = 26). Both 
classes participated in an individual pre-test writing, a writing task, and an individual post-test writing 
over a 9-week period. Students in the wiki group worked in pairs via wikis to produce an expository essay; 
students in the individual group produced their essays alone. Learners’ written production on the pre-test 
and post-test was analyzed in terms of content and organization, and linguistic complexity and accuracy. 
Results indicated a significant effect for wiki-mediated collaborative writing on the content quality and 
linguistic accuracy of learners’ individual writing in L2. Its effect on the organization and linguistic 
complexity, however, was less evident.

Introduction 
Writing is not simply an individual act; it is also an interactional and social process. To create meaningful 
contexts and authentic purposes for writing, as well as to emphasize accuracy in formal language, a number 
of researchers (e.g., Kowal & Swain, 1994; Swain & Lapkin, 1998) argue that second language (L2) writers 
should collaborate throughout the writing process. Such collaboration, during which time learners jointly 
produce a text, may promote a sense of co-authorship and hence encourage learners to exchange feedback, 
notice linguistic and organizational problems, and in turn contribute to decision making on all aspects of 
writing: content, organization, and language (Storch, 2002, 2005; Swain & Lapkin, 1998). 
Social technologies, such as wikis, Google Docs, and chats, have simplified collaboration opportunities 
between learners and brought renewed attention to L2 collaborative writing (Arnold, Ducate, & Kost, 2009; 
Aydin & Yildiz, 2014; Bikowski & Vithanage, 2016; Elola & Oskoz, 2010; Kessler, 2009; Kessler, 
Bikowski, & Boggs, 2012; Lee, 2010; Mak & Coniam, 2008; Miyazoe & Anderson, 2010). Wikis, as a 
form of asynchronous computer-mediated communication, are increasingly adopted in writing instruction 
(Lamb, 2004) to support collaborative learning (Richardson, 2010). 
With the development of computer-based technologies for L2 instruction and learning, research on how L2 
learners transfer knowledge and skills they have gained from wiki-mediated collaborative writing to 
subsequent individual writing deserves further investigation (Li & Zhu, 2013). Several studies have 
attempted to investigate this process, with a majority of them focusing on (a) the process of wiki-mediated 
collaborative L2 writing such as revisions by learners collaborating on projects using wikis, (b) learner 
perceptions of and attitudes toward incorporating wikis in writing instruction (e.g., Arnold et al., 2009; 
104 Language Learning & Technology 
 
Aydin & Yildiz, 2014; Elola & Oskoz, 2010; Kessler, 2009; Kost, 2011; Lee, 2010; Mak & Coniam, 2008; 
Storch, 2005), and (c) how learners branch out from individual contributions to collective production. They 
have not, however, explicitly addressed how wiki-mediated collective production helps individual L2 
writing performance. The present study aims to fill this gap. 
Collaboration in L2 Writing 
Over the past two decades, research has shown that learner collaboration facilitates L2 acquisition (Kim, 
2008; Lapkin, Swain, & Smith, 2002; McDonough, 2004; Storch, 1999, 2004; Swain & Lapkin, 1998). 
Collaborative learning is grounded in the social-constructivist paradigm of language learning. In this 
paradigm, learning begins as a social process that involves a community whose members share and build 
L2 knowledge together to accomplish a joint task (Pavlenko & Lantolf, 2000; Vygotsky, 1978). Language 
use is not only a means of communication, but also a cognitive tool enabling learners to work together to 
solve linguistic problems or co-construct language and knowledge (Donato, 2000; Swain & Lapkin, 1998). 
Since no two learners have the same strengths and weaknesses, when they work together, they can pool 
their different linguistic resources to provide scaffolded assistance to each other and achieve a performance 
level that is beyond their individual levels of competence (Ohta, 2001; Storch, 2005). Therefore, activities 
that foster interaction and co-construction of knowledge in the use of the target language are vital for the 
language learning classroom. 
Allowing L2 learners to complete a writing task together gives them the chance to interactively and 
collaboratively develop their writing skills (Storch, 2005). Such collaborative processes can enhance L2 
learning through joint scaffolding, “allowing learners to identify gaps in their own knowledge, to 
hypothesize about language, and most importantly, to discuss these aspects of language through the process 
of developing a jointly constructed text” (Wigglesworth & Storch, 2012, p. 365). Previous studies of L2 
collaborative writing have shown that in the process of co-authoring, learners consider not only lexis and 
grammatical accuracy, but also discourse (DiCamilla & Anton, 1997; Storch, 2002; Swain & Lapkin, 1998). 
L2 collaborative writing has also found support when compared to individual writing. For instance, Storch’s 
(2005) research showed that collaborative texts are superior in terms of syntactical complexity and 
grammatical accuracy. Studies by Fernández Dobao (2012), Storch and Wigglesworth (2007), and 
Wigglesworth and Storch (2009) also reported positive effects of collaboration on grammatical and lexical 
accuracy. A work by Shehadeh (2011) showed further that learners’ content and organization, as well as 
lexical accuracy, improved as a result of collaborative writing activities. Taken together, these studies 
suggest that pooled knowledge in collaborative writing activities enables L2 learners to produce texts of 
better quality. In addition, the collaboration may impact the composing processes and serve to lessen the 
cognitive load for the learners (Wigglesworth & Storch, 2009, 2012), leading to enhanced accuracy and 
complexity, as well as improved content and organization. 
Wikis and L2 Collaborative Writing 
Web 2.0 tools such as wikis and their support of social-constructive learning have increased their potential 
for L2 collaborative writing (Aydin & Yildiz, 2014; Kessler et al., 2012; Lee, 2010). A wiki is a web-based 
collaboration tool that allows users to easily create, view, and modify content in a participatory manner, 
using any web browser at any time. Collaboration is thus no longer bounded by the four walls of a classroom. 
The open editing and review structure of a wiki allows L2 learners to co-construct L2 knowledge by 
negotiating, arguing, and making revisions in knowledge, making a wiki a suitable tool for supporting 
collaborative writing outside the classroom (Castañeda & Cho, 2013; Parker & Chao, 2007). A wiki’s 
asynchronous support of online collaboration allows learners more opportunities to focus on form, due to 
the additional time available for reflection (Kessler, 2009; Lee, 2010). Its revision history indicates what 
changes have been made and by whom, increasing author accountability. Wikis thus offer writing 
instructors new opportunities to combine all the vital parts of writing instruction by allowing writers to 
focus on structure, organization, grammatical accuracy, and audience awareness, while still supporting the 
Hsiu-Chen Hsu and Yun-Fang Lo 105 
 
revision and drafting processes (Elola & Oskoz, 2010; Lund, 2008; Mak & Coniam, 2008). 
A number of studies have explored wiki-mediated L2 collaborative writing (e.g., Aydin & Yildiz, 2014; 
Elola & Oskoz, 2010; Kessler, 2009; Kessler & Bikowski, 2010; Kost, 2011; Lee, 2010; Oskoz & Elola, 
2010) and concluded that wikis engage learners in content brainstorming and foster collaborative 
scaffolding during which time learners can help each other re-organize content and correct errors. Lee 
(2010), for example, reported that during wiki collaboration, learners linguistically scaffolded each other 
to detect and correct errors at the sentence and the word levels. Learners were also found to make 
suggestions for improving content and organization, which resulted in reworking, refining, and fine-tuning 
already written content and organization (Oskoz & Elola, 2010). Additional studies on collaborative wiki 
writing (e.g., Aydin & Yildiz, 2014; Kessler, 2009; Kessler & Bikowski, 2010; Kost, 2011) also reported 
learners making both form- and content-related changes to the joint texts. Some studies reported more form-
related than content-related changes (e.g., Kost, 2011), while others revealed the converse (e.g., Aydin & 
Yildiz, 2014; Kessler, 2009). Nevertheless, both groups of studies agreed that when co-producing texts, 
learners not only self-edited their own writing, but also were also not hesitant to edit their peers’ postings, 
and both self- and peer-corrections resulted in a high level of accuracy. 
Taken together, through wiki-collaboration, learners are exposed to input from others, encouraged to 
produce enhanced output, given more opportunities to practice, and afforded the chance to provide 
linguistic feedback for themselves and peers (Ortega, 2007; Oxford, 1997; Swain, 1995; Vygotsky, 1978). 
Interestingly, however, except for studies by Wang (2015) and Bikowski and Vithanage (2016), none 
appear to have investigated the effect of wiki-mediated collaborative writing on L2 learners’ individual 
writing development, despite the various reported advantages of wiki collaborative writing. 
Wang (2015) divided his students between a wiki group and a non-wiki group. The students in each group 
worked in sets of four to draft, peer-edit, and revise the same two written assignments over a 12-week 
period. Pre-tests and post-tests were compared to determine the effect of wiki collaborative work on 
students’ improvement in their individual business writing. The results showed that though both groups 
improved over time, the wiki group achieved greater improvement in terms of audience awareness, 
organization, content and style, grammatical accuracy, and sentence structure in their business writing 
performance than their non-wiki counterparts. However, in Wang’s study both the wiki and the non-wiki 
groups involved group writing, and it could not be determined how much effort the students in the non-
wiki group contributed to the collaborative texts. The effect of wiki-mediated collaborative writing on 
individual L2 writing development thus remains unknown when compared to the effect of individual 
writing (a common practice in L2 writing class). 
Bikowski and Vithanage (2016), using Google Docs, an online wiki-like platform, reported a similar result. 
Students were divided into collaborative writing and individual writing groups. The collaborating students 
worked in groups of three or four to complete four different writing tasks. Pre- and post-test individual 
writings were compared. Like Wang (2015), Bikowski and Vithanage (2016) reported that both groups 
experienced gains in their overall individual writing; however, the students engaged in collaborative writing 
showed significantly higher mean gains from their pre- to post-test scores than the students engaged in 
individual writing. Nevertheless, in the study by Bikowski and Vithanage, the collaborative writing tasks 
were done in class and monitored by an instructor. It was unclear whether out-of-class collaboration could 
achieve a similar effect, and, if so, in which L2 writing aspects. Arnold and Ducate (2006) suggest that the 
collaborative learning experience can be affected by context. 
The present study was conducted to cover these gaps. This study contributes to the existing literature by 
examining not only how collaborative wiki writing helps individual student writing, but also how 
collaborative wiki writing helps individual student writing in an unmonitored context, outside of class. 
Research Questions 
Two research questions (RQs) are addressed in this study: 
106 Language Learning & Technology 
 
1. How does out-of-class wiki-mediated collaborative writing help L2 English writers improve their 
individual writing’s content and organization? 
2. How does out-of-class wiki-mediated collaborative writing help L2 English writers improve their 
individual writing in linguistic complexity and accuracy? 
Method 
Design of the Study 
This study followed a pre- and post-test design that aimed to examine the effect of wiki-mediated 
collaborative writing on L2 individual writing development over a 9-week period. The study was carried 
out with two intact junior English composition classes from an applied linguistics department at a 
Taiwanese university. The two writing classes followed a standardized curriculum and syllabus, used the 
same textbook, were given the same number of writing assignments, used standardized grading criteria, and 
met on the same day for two hours each week. One class (n=26) was assigned to be a wiki-collaborative 
writing group while the other class (n=26) was assigned to be an individual writing group (both are 
described more thoroughly below). Both classes participated in an individual pre-test writing, a writing task, 
and an individual post-test writing . All three writing tasks required the students to write expository prose 
essays. 
Participants 
A total of 52 students (16 males and 36 females), between 20 and 21 years old, participated in the study. 
Prior to the study, all the students had taken four semesters of required writing instruction (grammar, 
paragraph writing, and essay writing). They all had received instruction on how to produce grammatically 
correct sentences, organize them into paragraphs with clear topic sentences, and formulate well-organized 
academic essays with thesis statements and supporting and concluding paragraphs. They had also learned 
how to conduct peer reviews and respond to peer feedback for revising and editing. To ensure that the two 
classes had comparable writing proficiency, independent t-tests were run on students’ pre-test writing 
(described below). The results are deisplayed in Table 1. They confirmed no statistically significant 
differences between the two classes in the quality of content (t = -0.06, p = .957) and organization (t = 0.30, 
p = .763), as well as in linguistic complexity (mean number of clauses per T-unit [C/TU]: t = 1.74, p = .089; 
mean length of T-unit [MLT]: t = 1.90, p = .064; lexical variety [LV]: t = -0.08, p = .941; lexical 
sophistication [LS] t = 1.21, p = .232) and accuracy (weighted clause ratio [WCR]: t = 0.54, p = .595). Each 
of these measures is described in greater detail below.

Instruments 
Two writing tests (see Appendix A), designed in parallel form, were used in this study. The two writing 
Hsiu-Chen Hsu and Yun-Fang Lo 107 
 
tests were administered as pre- and post-tests. The time allowed for each task was 90 minutes. The topics 
of the two tests were chosen for their relevance to the participants’ immediate environment (i.e., food safety 
and media). Using Ellis’ (2003) criteria for evaluating language tasks, it was determined that the two writing 
tasks were similar in task difficulty since they involved similar amounts of task input, allotted the same 
amount of task completion time, required the same genre (i.e., expository), and resulted in the same outcome 
(i.e., a 4-paragraph written essay). The two tasks were also verified by two experts from the researchers’ 
department and were ascertained to be comparable in terms of difficulty. 
Procedure 
The study was conducted at the beginning of the semester. Each student in the two writing classes took the 
pre-test in the form of individual essay writing. 
Wiki Collaborative Writing Group 
For this group (7 males and 19 females), the instructor (the first author) designed a class wiki using 
Wikispaces (for a screenshot, see Figure 1). The students were experienced with computers and had 
experience working collaboratively on joint assignments in other courses; however, their wiki experience 
was limited. To familiarize these students with the wiki environment, the instructor demonstrated the 
features of the wiki (i.e., edit, comment, discussion, history) in class and designed a trial wiki page to 
provide further practice with the features before the actual wiki writing. After the trial, the students self-
selected partners (two to three in a group; 12 groups were formed) to create their own wiki pages. The 
students were allowed to self-select their partners to promote comfort and interaction. Though self-selected 
groups might have resultsd in symmetrical (i.e., equal ability) as well as asymmetrical (i.e., expert–novice) 
groupings, studies (e.g., Donato, 1994; Ohta, 1995; Storch, 2002, 2005) have suggested that when learners 
work together, they can take turns acting as experts and support each other in the completion of a shared 
assignment, no matter the type of grouping. Lee (2010) cautioned that individual contributions and 
collaborative effort were less likely to occur without proper guidance. The instructor thus provided the 
students guidelines (Appendix B), which were modeled after the studies by Lee (2010) and by Li, Chu, and 
Ki (2014). 
 
Figure 1. This is a screenshot of the class wiki page. 
The students were required to collaboratively write an expository essay out of class with at least four 
paragraphs and to create two drafts using the wikis. Each group was allowed to select their own topic but 
108 Language Learning & Technology 
 
was told to select a topic relevant to their immediate environment. Some topic brainstorming was done 
during a class meeting prior to wiki writing. Sample topics selected by the students included the European 
refugee crisis, reasons for divorce in Taiwan, the effects of staying up late, the stray dog issue in Taiwan, 
the effects of smartphones on teenagers, the benefits of eating organic foods, and the effects of low birth 
rate in Taiwan. 
Each group took two to three weeks to complete each draft, and each group submitted one joint essay. After 
the students turned in Draft 1, the instructor gave feedback regarding content, organization, and grammar. 
Following Lee (2010), the instructor’s assistance was kept to a minimum, and only global feedback was 
given, to encourage peer scaffolding. Upon receiving feedback, the students then made revisions 
collaboratively and turned in Draft 2. To hold students accountable for the writing task, the wiki essays 
were graded using (a) the essay grading rubric modeled after Neumann and McDonough (2014), and (b) 
the wiki grading rubric modeled after Lee (2010). The rubrics can be found in Appendix C. This project 
counted for 20% of the entire course grade. 
To examine whether the students interacted and collaborated during the collaborative writing processes, the 
wiki pages (including their comments, discussion spaces, and history pages) created by the 12 groups were 
analyzed for learner–learner collaborative dialogues, focusing specifically on negotiations over content, 
organization, and language. To identify language-related collaborative dialogues, the wiki pages were 
analyzed for the occurrence of language-related episodes (LREs), defined as “any part of a dialogue where 
the students talk about language they [produced], [questioned] their language use, or [corrected] themselves 
or others” (Swain & Lapkin, 1998, p. 326). Similarly, to identify content (and organization) related 
collaborative dialogues, the wiki pages were analyzed for the occurrence of content- and organization-
related episodes, defined as any part of a dialogue where the students talked about content messages they 
produced, questioned the clarity and relevance of information, or discussed the sequencing of information. 
(Details are reported below.) 
Individual Writing Group 
As for the individual writing group (9 males and 17 females), the same procedure described above was 
followed except for the wiki collaboration. The students wrote an expository essay out of class with at least 
four paragraphs and to create two drafts. Each student selected a topic relevant to their immediate 
environment. Topic brainstorming was done during a class meeting prior to individual writing. The topics 
selected by the students included the European refugee crisis, the negative effects of nuclear power, the 
reasons for boycotting barbecue in Taiwan, the effects of water pollution, the benefits of student 
volunteering, the prevention of dengue fever in Taiwan, and the benefits of having a college education. 
Each student took two to three weeks to complete each draft. Each member of the group turned in individual 
drafts. After the students turned in Draft 1, the instructor (the second author) gave feedback regarding 
content, organization, and grammar. The instructor's assistance was kept to a minimum, and only global 
feedback was given, to encourage self-repair. To accord with the wiki group, writing guidelines were given 
to the students (Appendix B). Upon receiving feedback, the students made revisions independently and 
turned in Draft 2. The individual essays were graded using the essay grading rubric (Appendix C). 
Measures 
The pre- and post-test essays from the learners in the two groups were analyzed for complexity and accuracy 
as well as for content and organization. To avoid bias, the pre- and post-test essays were photocopied; the 
student names and group information were replaced with random numbers. The absence of such information 
helped ensure that the assessment would be blind. The post-test was administered in both classes at the end 
of the project. Each student wrote another individual expository essay. Figure 2 summarizes the instruction 
for the two groups in the study.

Figure 2. This shows the timeline and procedure of the study. 
Content and Organization 
In the pre- and post-test essays, content and organization were rated on an 8-point analytical rating scheme 
(see Appendix D) modeled after the study by Neumann and McDonough (2014). The content of each essay 
was assessed by analyzing the development of the thesis, the coverage of the topic, the relevance of 
supporting details, and the conclusion of the main points. The organization of each essay was assessed in 
terms of fluency of expression and sequencing of ideas. The authors of this study first met to discuss the 
rating criteria and rated selected benchmark essays. Then, the authors compared each sample piece and 
discussed how it should be rated. After agreement was reached on the benchmark essays, the formal rating 
began, and the authors independently assessed the remaining essays. To determine inter-rater agreement, 
Pearson's correlation was performed. For the pre-test, a correlation coefficient r = .881 was obtained for 
content and r = .830 for organization. For the post-test, a correlation coefficient r = .857 was obtained for 
content and r = .828 for organization. The average of the two authors’ scores was used for analysis. 
Complexity and Accuracy 
Unlike content and organization, linguistic complexity and accuracy of the pre- and post-test essays were 
evaluated using the complexity and accuracy measures described below. The decision to use these measures 
was based on the argument that rating language samples on the two dimensions using analytical schemes 
could be too general to reflect the multidimensionality of the two aspects and might not be sensitive enough 
to capture occurring changes in the two dimensions of L2 production (see Brindley, 2009; Tonkyn, 2012). 
110 Language Learning & Technology 
 
For our study, we examined four measures of complexity (syntactic and lexical) and one measure of 
accuracy. The measures were largely the same as those used in other L2 collaborative writing research (e.g., 
Fernández Dobao, 2012; Storch, 2005; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2009) and were recommended in the 
theoretical literature (e.g., Foster & Wigglesworth, 2016; Jarvis, 2013; Norris & Ortega, 2009). 
The following complexity measures were used: 
• C/TU: C/TU was calculated by dividing the total number of separate clauses by the total number 
of T-units. 
• MLT: MLT was calculated by dividing the total number of words by the total number of T-units. 
• LV: This index of Guiraud, or root type-token ratio, was calculated by dividing the number of 
lexical types by the square root of the number of tokens. 
• LS: LS was calculated by a web-based lexical complexity analyzer (Ai & Lu, 2010; Lu, 2012) as 
the ratio of the number of sophisticated word types to the total number of word types in a text. 
Accuracy was measured by a WCR (see Evans, Hartshorn, Cox, & de Jel, 2014; Foster & Wigglesworth, 
2016). To calculate WCR in our study, clauses were assigned to one of four levels (i.e., entirely accurate, 
level 1, level 2, and level 3) based on their error gravity and received an accuracy score of 1.00, 0.80, 0.50, 
or 0.10, respectively. WCR was calculated by adding the total clause ratings for an essay and dividing the 
sum by the total number of clauses. 
To establish inter-rater reliability, another rater was trained. The rater and the first author coded 10 percent 
of the essays for T-units, clauses, and WCR. Inter-rater reliability for T-units, clauses, and WCR was 98%, 
95%, and 92%, respectively. 
Results 
Content Quality and Organization of L2 Individual Writing 
To answer RQ1, paired-samples t-tests were performed on the rating scores obtained within groups for 
quality of content and organization between the pre- and post-test writing, after checking the assumptions 
for using the t-tests. Likewise, independent t-tests were performed between groups on the rating scores 
attained on the post-test writing. From pre- to post-test (Table 2), the wiki collaborative writing group 
demonstrated a mean gain of 1.02 on content and 0.86 on organization. The individual writing group, in 
contrast, demonstrated a mean gain of 0.25 on content and 0.37 on organization. Results of paired-samples 
t-tests found statistically significant improvement in the wiki collaborative writing group in the quality of 
content (t =-6.00, p < .001, d = 0.87) and organization (t = -5.64, p < .001, d = 0.70). The individual writing 
group also scored higher in quality of content and organization, but the improvement did not reach statistical 
significance (t = -0.86, p = .397, d = 0.18 and t = -1.84, p = .078, d = 0.34, respectively). Table 3 shows the 
results of independent post-test t-tests for the two groups. The results indicate that the quality of content 
produced by the wiki collaborative writing group was significantly better than that produced by the 
individual writing group (t = 2.10, p = .041, d = 0.59). The scores for quality of organization produced by 
the wiki collaborative writing group were better than those produced by the individual writing group, but 
this difference did not reach statistical significance (t = 1.81, p = .076, d = 0.51).

Linguistic Complexity and Accuracy of L2 Individual Writing 
To answer RQ2, paired-samples t-tests were performed on the measures of complexity and accuracy 
between the pre- and post-test writing within groups, after checking the assumptions for using the t-tests. 
Likewise, independent t-tests were performed on the measures of complexity and accuracy on the post-test 
writing between groups. Table 4 displays the results between pre- and post-tests of paired-samples t-tests. 
The results indicate that the wiki collaborative writing group produced both syntactically more complex 
(C/TU: t = -2.19, p = .038, d = 0.48) and lexically more varied language (t = -4.74, p < .001, d = 0.71) in 
post-test writing than in pre-test writing. The wiki collaborative writing group also produced more accurate 
language in post-test writing than in pre-test writing (WCR: t = -5.46, p < .001, d = 0.78). Regarding the 
individual writing group, the group produced syntactically more complex (C/TU: t = -3.51, p = .002, d =

in post-test writing than in pre-test writing; however, no significant result was found for accuracy (WCR: t 
= -1.98, p = .059, d = 0.40). Table 5 presents the results for the two writing groups of independent post-test 
t-tests. These results demonstrate that the wiki collaborative writing group produced significantly more 
accurate language than the individual writing group (WCR: t =3.09, p = .003, d = 0.87). No significant 
results, however, were found for complexity (C/TU: t = 0.93, p = .359, d = 0.26; MLT: t = 0.37, p = .712, 
d = 0.10; LV: t = -0.81, p = .423, d = 0.23; LS: t = -0.40, p = .693, d = 0.11). 
Wiki Collaboration 
During the wiki collaborative writing processes, the 12 wiki writing groups generated a total of 341 learner-
learner collaborative dialogues (M = 28.42, SD = 12.13). Of the 341 collaborative dialogues, 91 (27%) were 
content-based (i.e., discussion of topic development and supporting details; M = 7.58, ranging from 2 to 23 
per group), 14 (4%) were organization-based (i.e., discussion of ideas sequencing, 12 of which were through 
outlining; M = 1.17, ranging from 1 to 3 per group), and 236 (69%) were language-based (i.e., detecting 
and correcting formal mistakes; M = 19.67, ranging from 6 to 38 per group). These data indicate that the 
learners in the wiki collaborative writing group interacted and collaborated with their partners during the 
out-of-class wiki collaborative writing processes, providing fidelity of implementation.

Discussion 
Improvement in Content Quality and Organization of L2 Individual Writing 
In our study, students in the wiki collaborative writing group demonstrated greater improvement in 
developing a topic (i.e., better content quality): this included covering the topic, developing the ideas, and 
using relevant details to support their thesis. The wiki group was engaged in an environment where the 
students had opportunities to read each other’s work and both give and receive feedback—opportunities 
missing when students write individually (Storch, 2005). Peer feedback, as Rollinson (2005) suggestes, 
“encourages a collaborative dialogue in which two-way feedback is established, and meaning is negotiated 
between the two parties” (p. 25). Peer feedback allows learners to know if their messages are effective and 
encourages them to reformulate their writing for better quality. According to the results of the learners’ 
wiki collaboration analyses, the wiki writers were indeed involved in giving each other feedback on content 
changes. During the collaborative writing processes, the wiki writers helped each other identify points of 
irrelevance, redundancy, and incomprehensibility. This, in turn, led to deletion of details (Example 1) and 
clarification or elaboration of information (Example 2).  
Hsiu-Chen Hsu and Yun-Fang Lo 113 
 
Example 1. Deletion of Details 
The sentence “Spouses may easily get emotionally connected with the opposite sex whether in working 
places or in public through frequent interaction,” written by Yuri, was highlighted by Annie in the joint 
text, followed by the discussion via the comment feature. 
Annie: Delete the sentence. It is not relevant. 
Yuri: I see. Ok. 
Example 2. Elaboration of Information 
The sentences “The constitution of Germany gives the police the authority to supervise and enforce a 
ban on these people who treated dogs badly. In Germany, having a dog needs to pay the tax. The law 
has this special regulation because the German government wants to make sure the dog owner has a 
basic economic foundation,” written by Ann, were highlighted by Nancy in the joint text, followed by 
the discussion via the comment feature. 
Nancy: Add “Being afraid of receiving a fine, dog’s owners won’t mistreat their dogs not to mention 
abandon them” after the sentence “The constitution of Germany gives the police the authority to 
supervise and enforce a ban on these people who treated dogs badly.” 
Nancy: Add “For example, when their dogs are sick, they can afford the expensive medical expenses” 
at the end. This way meaning is made more clear. 
Ann: I agree. Revised. 
As revealed in these examples, the wiki-mediated collaboration contributed to raising learners’ awareness 
of how adequately their ideas were developed and expressed. The collaboration also pushed the learners to 
reflect on how they conveyed their messages and stayed more focused on topics. Through wiki collaborative 
writing, knowledge of formal academic writing in L2 was created in the interaction between learners co-
constructing text together (Elola & Oskoz, 2010). It appears that such knowledge was subsequently applied 
to the individual writing task, leading to the production of better content quality in post-test writing than 
the individual writing group who received no such collaboration opportunities. 
With regard to organization, no statistically significant difference was revealed between the wiki 
collaborative and the individual writing group in the post-test writing, which ran counter to previous 
research that found a positive effect of wiki-mediated collaborative writing on the organization of individual 
writing (e.g., Wang, 2015). One possibility for this difference could be insufficient treatment sessions in 
the current study. Unlike Wang (2015), who engaged his learners in collaborating on two writing 
assignments over a 12-week period, the current study only engaged learners in collaborating on one writing 
task over a 9-week period. Though the wiki collaborative writing group was able to make significant 
development in the organization and sequencing of ideas between the pre- and post-tests (Table 2), the 
collaboration opportunities may have been insufficient. Another possibility could be related to the type of 
genre writing using in this study. Wang had his students write business letters, whereas the students in the 
current study worked on expository essays. It is widely accepted that the nature of interaction among 
learners is affected by the type of task (Pica, Kanagy, & Falodun, 1993; Robinson, 2001; Skehan, 1996a). 
In fact, previous wiki-based writing studies (e.g., Aydin & Yildiz, 2014) have demonstrated that learners’ 
collaborative behavior was differentially affected by the type of writing task they were working on. Based 
on the results of the learners’ wiki collaboration analyses, though the wiki writers did collaborate on 
organizing and sequencing their ideas, their effort was limited to the beginning stages of the wiki writing 
and was often done through outlining. During the collaborative writing process, more collaborative effort 
was made on improving content and language forms. This may partly explain why the improvement of 
organization was less evident in the learners’ individual writing when compared with that of content quality. 
Future research is needed to explore these issues further. 
114 Language Learning & Technology 
 
Development of Linguistic Complexity and Accuracy in L2 Individual Writing 
In addition to supporting improvement of content quality, the results of the current study reveal that wiki-
mediated collaborative writing improves the linguistic accuracy of individual writing in the L2, which 
agrees with Wang’s (2015) study. The analyses of the learners’ wiki collaboration showed instances of 
learners detecting and correcting each other’s formal mistakes. 
Example 3. Detecting and Correcting Mistakes 
Lily highlighted the word making in the sentence “For German, they had two reasons to accept refugees: 
bring skilled labor up to full strength, and making up for the Nazi’s atrocity during World War II,” 
written by Vicky, followed by the discussion via the comment feature. 
Lily: Should be simple form: make, because the verbs should be parallel. 
Vicky: Yes, should be parallel. I think I should change the verb ‘bring’ into ‘bringing’. I think that verb 
should not be put at the start. 
In Example 3, Lily detected a mistake in Vicky’s use of English parallel structure. She suggested that the 
gerund making should be changed into the verb base form make to make it parallel in form with the verb 
bring. Lily’s comment brought the structure to Vicky’s attention and led her to review and possibly rehearse 
the rule. Vicky then went on to modify the sentence accordingly. 
Example 4. Detecting and Correcting Mistakes 
Tim highlighted the word take in the sentence “In this case, with the smartphone usage proliferating all 
over the world, people should take seriously be aware of the negative effects caused by smartphones 
mentioned above,” written by Eddie, followed by the discussion via the comment feature. 
Tim: Redundant word. 
Eddie: It's a verb phrase. 
Eddie: I see. 
In Example 4, Tim detected Eddie’s mistake of using two verbs in one sentence. Eddie seemed to be puzzled 
by Tim’s comment at first and defended his sentence. A little while later, probably due to a re-analysis of 
the sentence structure, Eddie came to realize the kind of mistake Tim pointed out. He acknowledged it and 
went on to modify the sentence to In this case, with the smartphone usage proliferating all over the world, 
people should take seriously the negative effects caused by smartphones mentioned above. In line with 
previous findings (e.g., Arnold et al., 2009; Kessler et al., 2012; Kost, 2011; Lee, 2010; Wang, 2015), the 
use of wikis for writing activities provided learners with opportunities to edit and modify their text jointly, 
allowing them to detect and correct each other’s mistakes. Such peer collaboration and linguistic scaffolding 
could have contributed to fostering learners' attention to form (Lee, 2010). That, in turn, could have led to 
improving the accuracy of the learners’ individual L2 writing. 
Regarding linguistic complexity, the results of the current study revealed significant improvement in LV 
and C/TU for both the wiki collaborative and individual writing groups, but no significant difference 
between the two groups was found, suggesting that the improvement of writing complexity did not come 
solely from using wikis, but also from natural growth or other variables such as classroom instruction. The 
effectiveness of wiki collaborative writing on the improvement of the linguistic complexity of learners’ 
individual L2 writing was thus inconclusive. Since few, if any, studies have looked into the effect of wiki 
collaborative writing on L2 learners’ individual writing complexity, more studies are needed to explore this 
issue further. 
It should be noted, however, that although no significant difference was found for complexity between the 
two groups in post-test writing, the wiki collaborative writing group improved between pre- and post-test 
in both the complexity and accuracy dimensions (Table 4) of their individual L2 writing, whereas the 
Hsiu-Chen Hsu and Yun-Fang Lo 115 
 
individual group improved in terms of complexity, but not accuracy. Complexity, accuracy, and fluency 
have all been viewed as goals of L2 learning (Skehan, 1996b, 1998, 2003). Nevertheless, according to 
Skehan’s (1998) limited capacity model, there is a trade-off effect between linguistic complexity and the 
accuracy of L2 production; that is, committing attentional resources to one may lower performance on the 
other (see also Skehan, 2009). Wiki collaborative writing seemed to compensate for this effect, allowing 
for more balanced development in the two linguistic areas. Pooled knowledge in collaborative writing 
activities may have helped lessen the cognitive load for the learners (Wigglesworth & Storch, 2009, 2012), 
leaving them more room to attend to both the linguistic complexity and the accuracy of their jointly written 
product and leading them to the enhancement of both dimensions of language production in their post-test 
writing. The individual writing group members, on the other hand, seemed to devote more of their attention 
to the complexity dimension of their written products, and without input in the form of feedback from their 
peers seemed unable to improve accuracy to the level measured for the wiki group. 
Limitations and Future Directions 
Though the current study has shown the effectiveness of wiki collaborative writing on the development of 
individual writing in a L2, especially in the areas of content quality and linguistic accuracy, some limitations 
of the study must be acknowledged. First, the study was conducted in nine weeks with only one 
collaborative writing task implemented. This is a relatively short period and may be insufficient for such a 
study. Prolonged collaboration on more writing tasks may be necessary to allow other dimensions of L2 
writing (e.g., organization and linguistic complexity) to develop further. Next, five measures of complexity 
and accuracy were used to index the students’ linguistic development in their L2 individual writing. Some 
measures revealed significant results while others did not. More interesting findings may be revealed with 
different measurement tools (see Evans et al., 2014; Jarvis, 2013; Lu & Ai, 2015; Norris & Ortega, 2009). 
Another limitation is related to the type of task adopted. The current study adopted expository writing. 
Since the type of task can affect collaborative behavior in wiki-mediated writing environments (Aydin & 
Yildiz, 2014) and lead to different learning outcomes (Kessler & Bikowski, 2010), caution should be taken 
in generalizing the results of the current study to wiki environments where different types of tasks are used. 
Replication studies in wiki contexts with different types of writing task are highly desirable. 
A further point is that the grading of the wiki collaborative writing could have potentially affected the group 
writing processes. There might have been a tendency for the stronger group member to take control over 
the wiki project in order to earn a higher grade. Patterns of learner interaction in the wiki writing 
environment and how they led to different learning results were not explored in this study. This is certainly 
another area deserving further investigation (see Li & Zhu, 2013). 
In addition to the aforementioned issues, this study did not keep track of the amount of time the students 
actually spent collaborating. Future studies might benefit from taking into the amount of time devoted to a 
task when measuring gains in writing. 
Conclusion 
With the development of computer-based technologies for instruction and learning, research into L2 
development in technology-mediated contexts is necessary. This study reveals positive effects of using 
wikis on L2 writing development. Though not all the areas investigated (content, organization, linguistic 
complexity, and accuracy) demonstrated improvement, the findings still hold promise. The learners who 
engaged in wiki-mediated collaborative writing were able to make significant improvement in content 
development and linguistic accuracy of their individual L2 writing—all with little teacher intervention. 
Learners themselves were able to create learning contexts by collaborating and interacting with one another 
in wikis outside the classroom. 
For L2 writing instructors, the findings indicate a potential for incorporating wiki-mediated collaborative 
116 Language Learning & Technology 
 
writing as a supplement to their writing classes. Such collaborative writing activities move learners from 
the more one-way interaction between the teacher and the student, where the student only receives the 
teacher’s authoritative instruction and comments, toward the two-way interaction and negotiation between 
learners, where knowledge of L2 writing can be co-constructed. Through wiki collaborative writing, L2 
learners can become more aware of how adequately and accurately their ideas are conveyed in words and 
develop the ability to more critically analyze not only their own writing, but also their partners’ writing. 
Knowledge of academic writing regarding content development and linguistic accuracy in the L2 can be 
furthered in the interaction between learners constructing texts together via wikis. The adoption of wiki-
mediated collaborative writing in L2 writing instruction can thus help create a space beyond the classroom 
setting that can be used to facilitate learners’ writing processes and to foster the development of learners’ 
individual L2 writing.

In the non-stop cable news cycles, media channels are doing everything to attract viewers and beat their 
competitors. As a result, many non-stories are dressed up with dramatic music and flashy graphics to 
portray drama or fear and capture the attention of Taiwanese viewers. On a regular basis, in breaking 
news situations, channels get the facts wrong and make bold connections with little or no evidence. 
Write a 4–5 paragraph expository essay to explore the consequences of media exaggeration. Include at least 
2–3 main points and any relevant details to support the main points. 
Pay attention to content, organization, and language quality in your essay. 
Appendix B. Guidelines 
Wiki Collaborative Writing 
1. How do you write your wiki essay? 
a. Prewriting: Each pair needs to discuss the writing topic and agree on a general direction, 
using Discussion. Negotiate the division of labor and generate the main idea of each 
paragraph. 
b. Drafting: Write the first draft on your wiki page. Each student needs to work on the same 
piece of writing and should organize the structure of the joint composition. 
c. Revising: Read through the draft (both yours and your partner’s) and revise the draft for 
logical sequencing of ideas, full development of topic, correctness of content, relevance of 
supports, and appropriateness of conclusion based on your own and/or your partner’s 
feedback. Revise both your work and your partner’s. Make known (explain) the revisions you 
make on the essay through Discussion or Comment. 
d. Editing: Read through the entire draft and edit word choice, sentence structure, grammar, 
spelling errors, and punctuation problems. Make known (explain) the editing you make. 
Confirm the completion of your wiki writing, paste it onto a Word document, and submit it to 
i-Learning. 
2. How much do you need to write/revise? 
At least 4 paragraphs, approximately 500–750 words. Each student must contribute half the 
amount of writing. A minimum of 15 revisions/edits must be made on draft 1 and a minimum of 7 
revisions/edits on draft 2. 
3. What kinds of revisions/edits should you make? 
Be sure to (a) use a range of topic related vocabulary; (b) check the correctness of grammar (e.g., 
subject–verb agreement, number, verb tenses, etc.); (c) use a variety of sentence structures; (d) 
use cohesive devices (transitions) to present a logical progression of ideas; (e) check the 
development of the topic, the relevance of the thesis statement, topic sentences, and supporting 
details; (f) check spelling and punctuation; and (g) be original.

THE EFFECTS OF ITEM PREVIEW ON VIDEO-BASED MULTIPLE-
CHOICE LISTENING ASSESSMENTS

Multiple-choice formats remain a popular design for assessing listening comprehension, 
yet no consensus has been reached on how multiple-choice formats should be employed. 
Some researchers argue that test takers must be provided with a preview of the items prior 
to the input (Buck, 1995; Sherman, 1997); others argue that a preview may decrease the 
authenticity of the task by changing the way input is processed (Hughes, 2003). 
Using stratified random sampling techniques, more and less proficient Japanese university 
English learners (N = 206) were assigned one of three test conditions: preview of question 
stem and answer options (n = 67), preview of question stem only (n = 70), and no preview 
(n = 69). A two-way ANOVA, with test condition and listening proficiency level as 
independent variables and score on the multiple-choice listening test as the dependent 
variable, indicated that the amount of item preview affected test scores but did not affect 
high and low proficiency students’ scores differently. Item-level analysis identified items 
that were harder or easier than expected for one or more of the conditions, and the 
researchers posit three possible sources for these unexpected findings: 1) frequency of 
options in the input, 2) location of item focus, and 3) presence of organizational markers.

INTRODUCTION 
Multiple-choice (MC) response formats have been a popular technique for assessing listening 
comprehension for decades. Although they have been criticized for not representing natural listening 
conditions, MC test formats are still the prevailing mode of measuring listening ability (Buck, 2001; 
Thompson, 1995; Weir, 1990). This is no doubt, in part, because MC tests are a familiar format of 
assessment for test takers and because the tests can easily be scored by machines or hand-scored by raters 
with little or no training. Despite the widespread use of MC listening tests, consensus has not been 
reached on how much information to provide test takers through item preview. 
Research investigating the effect of information preview on the listening construct has altered the 
information preview of items by controlling the amount of information available to test takers (e.g., 
previews of answer options only or question stem only) and by controlling the number of questions to 
which test takers have access (e.g., presenting a subset of items or all items at once). Some researchers 
claim it is essential to have a purpose for listening, so test takers must be provided with a preview of the 
items prior to listening to the input (Buck, 1995; Sherman, 1997; Thompson, 1995; Vandergrift, 1999). 
Other researchers contend that allowing test takers an item preview may decrease the authenticity of the 
task by changing the way test takers process the input (Freedle & Fellbaum, 1987; Hughes, 2003; Wu, 
Dennis Koyama, Angela Sun, and Gary J. Ockey Effects of Item Preview 
 
Language Learning & Technology 149 
1998). For instance, test takers may focus only on catching key words found in the answer options rather 
than trying to comprehend the information provided in the input. 
Until recently, practical and technological issues have limited what test designers can present to test 
takers prior to the input. For example, with paper-and-pencil based tests, if a test designer wanted to 
postpone the presentation of items until after test takers have listened to the input, it was difficult to 
prevent test takers from turning ahead in the test booklet. It was also problematic to present the answer 
options one-by-one in audio format because test duration may become extended to the point of making 
the test administration impractical. Fortunately, technological advances have made it more feasible to 
choose whether or not to provide test takers with an item preview by controlling what test takers can see 
while taking a test. One way to do this is through video-based presentation of test items. This form of 
video-based assessment employs a video or computer screen as a canvas for the listening input and the 
question stem and answer options. The present study utilizes video-based test presentation to investigate 
the effects of the amount of item preview on MC listening test performance. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Multiple-choice Listening Assessments 
When developing an assessment instrument, a test designer must consider several factors such as the 
language proficiency of test takers and the effects of using a particular method of assessment (e.g., MC, 
open-ended format) on the interpretations of test takers’ scores (Brown, 2005; Carr, 2011; Fulcher, 2010). 
This means interpretations of listening test scores are a function of not only the test takers’ ability but also 
the method of assessment and various contextual factors. 
To help identify how test takers interact with listening tests, Wu (1998) identified the linguistic (e.g., 
vocabulary knowledge) and non-linguistic (e.g., world knowledge) test-taking strategies of 10 Chinese 
EFL learners with "intermediate-level proficiency or above in listening" through immediate retrospection 
to questions such as "What made you select that option?" (p. 28). Wu reported that some test takers relied 
on world knowledge and personal impressions to help them select the correct response, which means the 
key was selected for reasons other than comprehension of the information provided by the aural input. 
She concluded that the use of MC formats threatens the construct validity of listening assessments 
because test takers can be (mis)guided by their world knowledge, personal beliefs, and a preview of 
question stem and options. Hansen and Jensen (1994) also noted how having access to question stems and 
options can distract test takers from focusing on the input, and that long passages can tax their working 
memory. Other researchers have noted how test formats might cloud score interpretations, as performance 
on open-ended questions is poorer than performance on MC questions, suggesting that the recall of 
information from passages is easier than the generation of accurate information (Brindley, 1998). 
Information Preview and Audio-only Listening Assessments 
Research on the effects of information preview on L2 listening comprehension has largely been limited to 
audio-only assessments. This line of research has included investigation of the effects of the distribution 
of information (e.g., Sherman, 1997), the form of pre-listening support (e.g., Chang & Read, 2006), and 
the type of available information (e.g., Yanagawa & Green, 2008). The effects of information preview on 
audio-only forms of listening assessment remain unclear. Sherman (1997) used a Latin square design to 
investigate the performance of test takers (N = 78) on an audio-based listening exam. In her study, the test 
takers listened to an audio prompt twice and were given listening comprehension questions at three times: 
(a) before the audio sample played, (b) between the first and second playing of the sample, and (c) after 
the sample played twice. A fourth condition, the control, had test takers listen to an aural prompt twice 
without any preview of information, and respond to open-ended questions about the aural input. The Latin 
square design randomized conditions across test takers to account for exposure and practice effects, and 
the results showed that test takers scored highest under the "sandwich condition" (p.192) in which the

Language Learning & Technology 150 
questions came after the first but before the second playing of the sample. The control condition, no 
information preview, yielded the lowest scores and was identified in follow-up interviews as the least 
preferred mode of input. Follow-up interviews and questionnaires also revealed that test takers preferred 
to preview the question before hearing the audio input because they believed it helped them focus their 
attention. 
Chang and Read (2006) investigated the performance of 160 EFL students on a MC listening 
comprehension test that utilized four types of listening support: (a) preview of questions, (b) repetition of 
input, (c) provision of background knowledge, and (d) vocabulary instruction. They found that a preview 
of the question stem and options before hearing the listening input increased scores of test takers with 
higher levels of proficiency but not the scores of test takers with lower proficiency. This finding contrasts 
that of Sherman (1997) who found that low-level learners benefited more from question and options 
previews compared to high-level learners. While the participants of both studies were EFL learners, there 
may have been design issues that led to this difference in results. In Chang and Read’s (2006) study, all 
test takers took the same test with differing information preview conditions. In Sherman’s (1997) study, 
each of the four participant groups experienced all conditions of information preview, but they took 
different versions of a set of tests. This means that while all participants in Sherman’s study had the 
question and options preview, each of the four participant groups was administered a test with a different 
topic. Since there was no control for test topic and the test forms contained different information, 
conclusions about the effects of listening preview should be interpreted with caution. 
One study that controlled for content and listening ability was conducted by Yanagawa and Green (2008). 
Yanagawa and Green investigated the effect of having a question stem and options preview, a question 
stem only preview (i.e., no options), and an options only preview (i.e., no question stem) for 279 TOEIC 
test takers. Test takers were randomly assigned to one test format, and an ANOVA of TOEIC listening 
scores verified the language skill equivalence of treatment groups. They found that test takers with a 
preview of the question and options and test takers with a preview of the question stem only scored 
significantly higher than test takers with a preview of the options only. No difference was found, 
however, when scores of test takers with the maximum information preview were compared to the group 
with the question only preview. Yanagawa and Green (2008) suggested that test takers may (mis)use 
lexical matching strategies when they become distracted by options that are recognizable as part of the 
listening input. Thus, depending on the test taker, using lexical matching strategies is not always 
beneficial to listening scores. 
Information Preview with Video-based Listening Assessments 
Only one study that investigated video-based listening assessment with information preview could be 
identified. Berne (1995) manipulated the type of information available to test takers before viewing the 
video input. Berne investigated the effect of multiple showings of a video prompt across 62 tertiary 
Spanish learners tested in one of three conditions: (a) preview of the question stem, (b) preview of 
vocabulary words from the video input, and (c) no listening support at all. The purpose of the presentation 
of the question was to give test takers some information to organize their thoughts and predict what they 
may hear in the input (i.e., a top-down approach), while the purpose of giving the vocabulary word list 
was to provide assistance with lexical familiarity issues that had been identified as a source of listening 
comprehension difficulties for test takers (i.e., a bottom-up approach). The results showed that the 
question preview group outperformed the no listening support group, but not the vocabulary preview 
group. While Berne’s (1995) study suggests that access to some information related to the input can 
facilitate listening comprehension, other research has shown that access to questions while listening does 
not significantly affect test scores. 
Though not directly pertaining to the effects of item preview, Wagner’s (2013) study is also relevant to 
this review. Wagner investigated the effects of test takers’ access to the test question while the video or

audio-text was presented. In his study, test takers (N = 192) were assigned one of four treatment 
conditions: (a) video-based input with access to test questions while the stimulus was presented, (b) 
video-based input without access to the test questions while the stimulus was presented, (c) audio-only 
input with access to the questions while the stimulus was presented, and (d) audio-only input without 
access to the test questions while the stimulus was presented. Wagner found that mode of input had a 
weak (r2 = .04) effect on test taker scores, whereas access to test questions while listening did not 
significantly affect test scores. 
Overall, the research suggests that item preview may increase test scores under certain conditions, but it is 
not clear which forms of item preview (e.g., question stem and options, question only, options only) 
benefit test takers most, whether high- and low-level learners are differentially affected by item preview, 
or (at the item level) which types of items might be affected differently by the amount of information 
preview. The purpose of this study was to shed some light on these unanswered questions. Our study 
addressed the following research questions. 
RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
1. What is the relationship among test condition (preview of question stem and options, preview of 
question stem only, and no preview), test taker listening ability, and test score? 
2. Are any items harder or easier than expected when presented in a condition with a preview of the 
question and options as compared to a condition with a preview of the question only, and are any 
items harder or easier than expected when presented in a condition with a preview of the question 
and options as compared to a condition with no preview? 
3. If items are found to be unexpectedly harder or easier depending on the information preview 
provided, what characteristics might explain these findings? 
Because the most common practice has been to present both the question stem and options prior to 
listening, we compared this condition to the question only and no preview conditions (i.e., research 
question #2) for the item level analysis. Given that question only and no preview formats are less 
common, we did not make a comparison between these two formats. 
METHODS 
Participants 
The participants in the study were 206 first-year Japanese university students in Japan who were majoring 
in English. They were studying in eight different classes at the time of the current study, had intermediate 
levels of listening ability as measured by scores on the listening section of the TOEFL ITP. Their scores 
ranged from 38 to 60, with a mean of 48 and a standard deviation of 3.81. 
Instrument 
Following the advice of Dunkel (1991), a video-based listening test was created to include a variety of 
listening input. It is important to note that to facilitate ease of reading and to avoid redundancy of terms, 
the remainder of the current paper will refer to the listening input that corresponds to a set of questions as 
a scene. When the whole listening test is addressed, the term input will be used to remain congruent with 
the literature review. With this in mind, the input employed in this study had six loosely related scenes 
with between six and nine questions per scene for a total of 44 MC items. Three items were not included 
in the final analysis (two were dropped due to unclear answer options and one was excluded because it 
was too easy). To avoid confusion, the test is referred to as a 41-item MC test throughout the paper. Two 
of the scenes were monologues in the form of presentations. The other four scenes were casual 
conversations discussing situations with which university students are likely to be familiar, such as asking

a classmate about a missed class session and planning a holiday tour. The scenes lasted between 1 min 32 
s and 3 min 35 s. They featured actors and actresses who were Australian, British, and American English 
speakers as well as one highly proficient Japanese speaker of English. A description of the scenes can be 
found in Table 1.

Each of the 41 MC items had four options and included one of two types of listening focus, explicit or 
implicit (Buck, 2001). Explicit listening foci required test takers to answer questions about specific and 
local information in the scene (e.g., time, location, or activity of a character). An example of an explicit 
focus detail question is: 
1. What does Amy plan to do on Saturday? 
The object of some listening foci in the input was not stated in exact lexical terms but as a synonym. An 
example of a synonym-based item, noted in italics for the following sentences, is: Amy says, "I’m going 
to the gym after lunch" and the item reads, 
2. What will Amy do this afternoon? 
The portion of the dialogue "…after lunch" and the portion of the question stem 2 "…this afternoon" are 
synonymous. 
The other type of listening focus was implicit, which required test takers to synthesize information from 
an entire scene and make generalizations or conclusions about the main idea or the purpose of the scene, 
or about the attitude or personality of a character. An example of an implicit question is, 
3. The most suitable title for this presentation is ______. 
Another implicit item type required test takers to make inferences from parts of the scene. For example, in 
a scene in which the character, Amy, uses phrases like "I got it, Mom" and "Just leave me alone. " The 
item reads, 
4. Amy’s attitude was ____. 
As sample question 4 shows, test takers must infer that Jane was frustrated with her mother from the 
phrases used throughout the scene. To balance the format of the question types, approximately half of the 
items were written in the interrogative form, as seen in example questions 1 and 2, while the other half 
were in the sentence completion, as seen in example question 3 and 4. 
Procedure 
Students from each of the eight classes were assigned to one of three testing conditions (descriptions are 
provided in the next section). Stratified random sampling was used to ensure that the three conditions had

Language Learning & Technology 153 
test takers with similar listening abilities. Each class had between 24 and 28 students, and these classes 
were split into thirds with approximately eight students from a given class randomly assigned to all three 
conditions. To help determine whether this stratified random sampling procedure selected students of 
similar listening proficiency for each of the conditions, the listening abilities of the three conditions were 
compared based on their TOEFL ITP listening scores. A one-way ANOVA was conducted using 
grouping as the independent variable and TOEFL ITP score as the dependent variable. The average 
listening abilities of the test takers in the three conditions were not found to be significantly different: F(2, 
203) = 1.34, ns. Although this procedure provided further evidence the three conditions had test takers 
with similar listening abilities, TOEFL ITP listening scores were not used as a covariate in the study 
because these scores were obtained approximately six months prior to the other measures used in the 
study. Although all test takers received the same amount of instruction during the six months, their 
listening proficiency could not be assumed to have developed at exactly the same rate. 
The test was presented on large screen TVs to test takers in each testing room for the three separate 
conditions. A teacher was present in every testing room to administer the test and ensure that the test 
followed consistent procedures. The tests were administered over a two week period to the different 
classes. 
Description of Conditions 
The test takers in each condition were given a different test booklet according to their input condition. A

Notes. Q-option = preview of questions and options, Q-only = preview of questions only, No-prev = no preview condition. 
Test takers in the first condition, referred to as question and options (Q-option), were given a test booklet 
that included the question stem and options printed on one page for each scene and some scratch paper for 
taking notes. The Q-option booklet was designed to show all information for only one scene at a time; 
additionally, a sheet of paper with the names and photographs of the characters in the video was inserted 
in the test booklet. Test takers in the Q-option condition were given a set amount of time to preview their 
test booklets before viewing each scene. It is important to note that the amount of time to preview 
information varied according to the number of questions for a given scene, but the time was determined 
systematically by allotting 8 s per question (e.g., for a six-question scene, 48 s of preview time was 
provided before the video played). This time allotment was determined based on time given and shown to 
be appropriate on previous versions of the video-based test. After viewing each scene, test takers in the Q-
option condition had 17 s to select a response to each item, but they were not permitted to turn ahead in 
the test booklet (e.g., for a six-question scene, 1 min 42 s were provided to answer all six questions). 
During this time, the video screen showed the phrase “Please answer questions ___ to ___” and a timer 
counting down the total number of minutes and seconds for this set of questions. Thus, a scene with six 
questions would have a timer that counted down from “1:42”. After the timer expired, a bell sounded 
twice to indicate a new passage was going to play and directions to turn the page were displayed on the 
screen. The question and options were not displayed on the video screen at any time for this condition. 
Test takers in this condition experienced a traditional listening MC test with maximal amounts of 
information preview (Buck, 2001; Freedle & Fellbaum, 1987; Rost, 2002), and close invigilation was 
Dennis Koyama, Angela Sun, and Gary J. Ockey Effects of Item Preview 
 
Language Learning & Technology 155 
required to prevent test takers from looking ahead in the test booklet. With the exception of a countdown 
timer indicating the amount of time left for an item on the screen and the use of video for the input, there 
was no technological control of information preview for test takers in this condition. 
Test takers in the second condition, the question stem only (Q-only), were given a test booklet that 
included only the question stems for the scenes and some scratch paper for taking notes. As in the Q-
option condition, test takers in Q-only had access to information for only one scene at a time; however, 
the Q-only condition presented test takers with the question stems and not the options. Test takers had 8 s 
to preview each question stem before viewing the scene (e.g., for a six-question scene,48 s of preview 
time was provided before the video played). After the scene played, the video screen showed one item 
with the question and its four options as well as the names and the photographs of the relevant characters, 
and a countdown timer in the bottom right corner of the screen helped the test takers manage their time 
(see Appendix for a screen shot of an item). The test takers had 24 s to respond to each item, after which a 
bell sounded indicating that a new item was to be displayed. After all the questions were sequentially 
shown, another bell sounded twice to indicate a new scene was going to play and directions to turn the 
page were displayed on the screen. The design for Q-only demonstrates how technology can control the 
amount of information available to test takers by limiting them to a question stem only preview. 
Technology controls testing conditions by preventing test takers from seeing the options, which may 
otherwise have helped them predict what they would need to listen for (Wu, 1998; Yanagawa & Green, 
2008). 
Test takers in the third condition, no preview (No-prev), were given a test booklet that included only 
blank pages for taking notes. These test takers watched each scene having previewed neither the question 
stems nor the options. After each scene, the video screen displayed each question and its options as well 
as the names and the photographs of the relevant characters. This screen was identical to the Q-only 
condition (Appendix). Also similar to the Q-only condition, there was a 24 s countdown timer and a bell 
prompting the test takers to watch the screen and move on to the next item. The design for the No-prev 
condition utilized technology to prevent any information preview, regardless if a test taker were to look 
ahead in the booklet. On one hand, by removing the preview of the questions prior to listening to the 
input, listeners would be deprived of a specific purpose for listening (Buck, 1995; Sherman, 1997; 
Thompson, 1995; Vandergrift, 1999). On the other hand, not providing an item preview might increase 
the authenticity of the listening task as question and options are not available to interact with test takers’ 
processing of the input (Freedle & Fellbaum, 1987; Hughes, 2003; Wu, 1998; Yanagawa & Green, 2008). 
ANALYSIS 
To investigate the relationship among test formats (the three conditions), test taker listening ability, and 
test score, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. To prepare the data for the analysis, 
scores were separated into three listening proficiency groups (high, middle, and low) based on 
corresponding scores on the TOEFL ITP listening assessment. The middle third was excluded from this 
part of the analysis to make an extreme groups design. The purpose of using this design was to increase 
the power in the study for uncovering a possible relationship between test condition and test taker 
listening ability, since previous research discussed in the literature review had provided mixed findings on 
this issue. In the two-way ANOVA, test condition (Q-option, n = 47; Q-only, n = 48; and No-prev, n = 
43) and test taker listening ability (based on upper one-third and lower one-third of TOEFL ITP listening 
scores) were used as independent variables, and score on the MC listening test was used as the dependent 
variable. 
While a test-level analysis is important for understanding general effects of a set of items on scores, it 
cannot provide a clear indication of the effects of certain item types on scores. Thus, an item level 
analysis was also conducted. For this analysis, an item response theory (IRT) approach was used as 
implemented in Bilog-MG (Zimowski, Muraki, Mislevy, & Bock, 2003). The procedure was used to 
Dennis Koyama, Angela Sun, and Gary J. Ockey Effects of Item Preview 
 
Language Learning & Technology 156 
identify items that were unexpectedly harder or easier when comparing the commonly encountered Q-
option test condition (n = 67) and the Q-only condition (n = 70), and when comparing the Q-option 
condition and the No-prev condition (n = 69). Difficulty of items was not compared between the less 
commonly encountered Q-only and No-prev conditions. All test takers were included in this analysis (N = 
206). 
Item response theory (IRT) is an approach that links observed performance, in this case, scores on the MC 
listening test, to a location on an underlying latent continuum of ability, in this case, listening ability. IRT 
is generally believed to provide more accurate estimates of listening ability than raw test scores (e.g., 
Embretson & Reise, 2000). IRT uses a logit measurement scale that is set to have a center point of zero. 
Items with positive logits are more difficult than average while items with negative logits are easier than 
average (Ockey, 2012). A 1-parameter logistic model (de Ayala, 2009) was selected, and only item 
difficulty was modeled in the analysis. We used this simplest IRT model because the number of 
participants in the study was too small for a more complex IRT model. Simpler models require fewer 
participants because there are fewer parameters to estimate (Ockey, 2012). A principal components 
analysis to assess the IRT assumption of unidimensionality suggested that the data set was appropriate for 
the analysis. However, it should be noted that while IRT is commonly used with passage-based inputs 
which use more than one item, such data may not completely satisfy the IRT assumption of local 
independence (So, 2010). 
To determine if certain item types were more difficult than expected for one or more of the formats, we 
used differential item functioning, a procedure for identifying items that are harder or easier for particular 
test taker conditions, as implemented in BILOG MG (see Geranpayeh & Kunnan, 2007; Ockey, 2007 for 
examples in applied linguistics). This procedure can also be used to compare item difficulty across test 
formats (Embretson & Reise, 2000). In the first step, the overall effects of condition are estimated. In the 
second step, the items in each condition are adjusted for this overall effect. In step three, the difficulty of 
these items is compared to see if any is easier or harder than expected after accounting for a condition 
effect at the test level1 (du Toit, 2003; Embretson & Reise, 2000). Step 1 indicated that at the test level, 
that is, when averaged across items, the Q-only condition was 0.19 logits more difficult than Q-option 
condition, and the No-prev condition was 0.81 logits more difficult than Q-option condition. In step 2, 
BILOG MG adjusted the difficulty of each of the items to make them comparable across formats. Thus, 
0.19 logits was subtracted from each of the 41-item scores of the test takers in the Q-only condition, and 
0.81 logits was subtracted from each of the 41-item scores for those in the No-prev condition. In step 3 of 
the process, these adjusted difficulties were compared for each item between the scores of the test takers 
who took the Q-option and Q-only condition and the scores test takers who took the Q-option and No-
prev condition. After these adjustments, items found to be significantly more or less difficult than 
expected were identified. 
To determine possible explanations for the unexpected level of difficulty of items, a micro-level item 
content analysis was conducted. Two researchers carefully analyzed the video input by cross-referencing 
the scripts used by the actors to the dialogue in the video. The researchers worked together and examined 
the eight items for(a) explicit or implicit focus (inclusively called the "item focus"; Buck, 2001); (b) exact 
match, synonymous match, or no match between words in the item and words spoken in the scene; (c) 
frequency of words in the question stem or options spoken by characters in the scene; (d) location of item 
focus in the scene measured by minutes and seconds elapsed; and (e) use of organizational markers by 
characters in the scene. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The descriptive statistics and estimates of reliability (based on Cronbach’s Alpha) for the three test 
conditions are presented in Table 3. As can be seen, reliability estimates were all near .70, suggesting that 
all conditions similarly distinguished test takers on their listening abilities. One item which had a

difficulty of .98 and a point-biserial of .05 was excluded from the analysis based on the reliability analysis 
(leaving 41 items in the final data set). After excluding this item, difficulty ranged from .26 to .95. Items 
were spread throughout the difficulty range, although the average of .75 suggested the test was easy for 
the students and likely resulted in the somewhat marginal reliabilities of the test conditions. Classical Test 
Theory point-biserials were between .08 and .45, with the large majority near or above .30. Analysis 
indicated that excluding one or more of the items with low point-biserials had minimal impact on the 
reliability, so no other items were excluded from the analysis.

As can be seen in Table 3, the overall mean on the MC listening test was 29.93 out of 41 with a standard 
deviation of 4.58. The means and standard deviations of the Q-option, Q-only, and No-prev were 31.27, 
30.43, and 28.13, respectively, indicating that as more preview was available to the test takers, the easier 
the test became. This result is presented in boxplots (see Figure 1); for each condition, the median is 
indicated by a bold line and the mean has been provided in text format. Skewness and kurtosis values

kurtosis values were all less than the absolute value of 3, suggesting that the assumption of normality was 
tenable (Kline, 2005), and therefore the data were appropriate for ANOVA procedures. Levine’s test 
indicated that the assumption of homogeneity of variance was also met for each ANOVA procedure. 
Test Level Analyses 
To determine the extent to which condition, test taker listening ability, and test score were related, a two-
way ANOVA, as implemented in PASW 18, was conducted with test condition (Q-option, Q-only, and 
No-prev) and test taker listening ability (as measured by TOEFL ITP) as independent variables, and the 
score on the MC listening assessment as the dependent variable. Not surprisingly, there was a statistically 
significant main effect for test taker listening ability, F(1, 132) = 71.8, p < .05, η2 = 0.35, indicating that 
test takers with higher listening ability performed significantly better than those with lower listening 
ability. This finding provides some indication that the test, independent of condition, was a valid indicator 
of listening ability. 
An effect was also found for test condition, F(2, 132) = 71.8, p < .05, η2 = 0.10, indicating that 10% of the 
variance in test scores could be attributed to the condition the test takers were assigned. We did not, 
however, find a significant interaction between test condition and test taker listening ability, F(2, 132) = 
1.3, ns, suggesting that test condition did not affect high- and low-level test takers differently. That is, test 
takers at different ability levels were equally impacted by their test condition. This result does not imply, 
however, that no test taker was more or less affected by one of the conditions; it only indicates that on 
average more and less proficient test takers were not impacted differently by test conditions. These 
findings do not support Chang and Read’s (2006) conclusion that test takers with high levels of listening 
ability benefited more from Q-option than those with low levels of listening ability. Neither do the 
findings support those of Sherman (1997), who noted that more information benefited lower ability test 
takers. 
A possible explanation for these contradictory findings is that some item types affect test takers with 
certain ability levels differently while other item types do not. Such an effect would only manifest itself at 
the test level when a sufficient number of items that have such an impact are present. This suggests the 
importance of investigating specific item types to determine their effects on high- and low-level test 
takers. Given that our findings contradict those of Chang and Read (2006) and Sherman (1997), further 
research is recommended before such procedures for adapting an assessment are used. 
Because scores were not found to be significantly associated with test condition, the complete data set 
was analyzed with test condition (Q-option, Q-only, and No-prev) as an independent variable and test 
score as the dependent variable in a one-way ANOVA. The results further confirmed that test condition 
led to significantly different scores on the test, F(2, 203) = 9.30, p < .05, η2 = 0.09. Tukey’s HSD post hoc 
analysis indicated that the Q-option condition was significantly easier than the No-prev condition and that 
the Q-only condition was significantly easier than the No-prev condition. Scores on the Q-option and Q-
only conditions were not found to be significantly different. 
Item Level Analyses 
Table 4 presents the results for percent correct on each of the conditions. Based on the test level analyses, 
the percent correct for the Q-option condition would be expected to be somewhat, although not 
significantly, higher than the Q-only condition, which would be somewhat higher than the No-prev 
condition. Items that did not follow this pattern were identified in the IRT analysis as unexpectedly harder 
or easier across the test conditions.

instance, for item 9, it can be seen in Table 4 that a larger percentage of test takers in the No-prev 
condition answered correctly than those in the Q-only condition and a larger percentage of test takers in 
the Q-only condition answered correctly than those in the Q-option condition. The asterisk by item 9 in 
Table 5 indicates that this effect was significant. An asterisk by a positive number indicates an opposite 
effect, in which the item was significantly easier than expected for the Q-option condition as compared to 
the Q-only condition or as compared to the No-prev condition. An example is item 38 for which the 
differences in the percentage of test takers that answered the item correctly on the conditions were larger 
than expected.

As can be seen in Table 6, eight items were found to be unexpectedly harder or easier, after adjusting for 
test conditions, for at least one of the test conditions. An item-level analysis was performed and three 
possible reasons were found which may explain why the test takers performed differently under the three 
conditions. The three factors were (a) the frequency of mention of the options, (b) the placement of the 
item focus, and (c) the presence of organizational markers in the listening scene. The frequency of 
mention refers to the number of times words in the option were spoken by the characters in the scene. If a 
character mentioned an option more than twice, it was marked as frequently mentioned. For instance, if 
the option is "backpack" and a character says the word "backpack" three times in the scene, the option 
was coded as "frequently mentioned". The placement of the item focus indicates the position of the 
necessary information to answer an item in the script In other words, it refers to whether the character 
spoke the line containing the necessary information to answer a given question at the beginning, in the 
middle, or at the end of the scene. Using video editing software, this was marked by the minutes and 
seconds elapsed from the beginning of the passage to the first time words pertaining to the item were 
spoken by a character. Organizational markers refer to phrases that signal the organizational pattern of the 
passage, such as "first," "second," and "to conclude." Four of the items and possible reasons for the 
differences in test takers’ performance will be discussed. The other four items share the same three factors 
and possible reasons for differences in test taker performance; therefore, these items will not be further 
explained. 
The first factor that may have affected test takers’ performance across the three test conditions is the 
frequency of option mentions in the listening scene. The effect of this factor can be seen in item 9, which 
corresponded to a monologue in which a school official presented information to new students during an

Language Learning & Technology 162 
orientation session. Item 9 is an example of explicit focus items for which options were frequently 
mentioned in the scene in the form of exact lexical overlapping or of synonyms (e.g., example question 2 
from above). On item 9, the Q-only and the No-prev test takers performed better than expected when 
compared to the Q-option test takers. This may have occurred because incorrect options, which were only 
continuously visible in the Q-option condition, were mentioned multiple times throughout the scene. 
Thus, the test takers who had previewed the question stem and options may have relied on a lexical 
matching strategy of listening for key words or phrases, thereby choosing a frequently mentioned option. 
This finding is analogous to the findings of Wu (1998) and Yanagawa and Green (2008). 
The second factor that could have caused items to behave differently is the placement of the item focus in 
the input. Item 27 is the first item corresponding to a scene that was an academic presentation on an eco-
village. This item required test takers to select the season during which the character visited an eco-
village. The Q-option condition scored higher than expected when compared to the No-prev condition on 
this item. This may have occurred because the focus of the item appeared relatively early in the listening 
scene (approximately 6 s into the monologue) and was not frequently mentioned. The No-prev test takers 
might have been negatively affected because they were not prepared to answer this item, whereas the Q-
option test takers may have been prepared to listen for language related to seasons of the year. It is 
possible that the No-prev test takers did not pay much attention or did not take detailed notes while 
listening to this early part of the presentation. 
Items 29 and 37 illustrate how the presence of organizational markers in the listening scene may have 
helped the Q-option group score higher than expected as compared to the No-preview group. Item 29, 
which corresponded to the eco-village presentation described above, had a focus related to two main ideas 
in the presentation. In the listening scene, the character stated, "There are two things that are very 
important to people living in an eco-village: one is making their own food, and the other is not wasting 
resources like water." Because the character used organizational markers such as "there are two," "one is," 
and "the other is" to introduce these main ideas, there was strong lexical overlap between the scene and 
the question stem. This may have caused test takers in the Q-options condition to score higher than 
expected when compared to test takers in the No-prev condition. These findings are in line with those of 
Chaudron (1983) and other researchers (e.g., Freedle & Fellbaum, 1987; Vandergrift, 1999; Wu, 1998). 
Similar to item 29, item 37 corresponded to a scene in which a character used an organizational marker. 
The scene is a dialogue between two friends discussing several activities to do during a holiday tour, and 
one of the characters stated, "On day one, we can...". The temporal marker "day one" may have aided the 
Q-option test takers, who performed better than expected when compared to both the Q-only and the No-
prev test takers. The Q-only condition had a preview of the question stems before listening to the scene, 
but they were not able to answer as accurately as the Q-option group. This was most likely because the 
characters discussed several activities to take place on "day one" and the Q-only group could only rely on 
their notes and memory, which may not have included the detail that was the key. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We found that presenting a preview of the question stems and options or question stem only made the test 
less difficult than presenting no preview at all. Our research did not support the contention that test takers 
with different English proficiencies were differentially impacted by information preview. We did find that 
some items were harder or easier than expected dependent upon the condition and the interaction between 
the content of the input and the item type. Based on an item level content analysis, we hypothesized that 
frequency of mention of the options, the placement of the item focus, and the presence of organizational 
markers in the listening input may be factors that affect the differential difficulty of the items across 
conditions. 
After taking into account the effect of test conditions, the result that some types of items are harder or

Language Learning & Technology 163 
easier than expected across the three test conditions provides useful information for test designers and test 
users as they consider the test format to be used and as they carefully define the construct they wish to 
measure. For instance, if item writers aim to assess general listening comprehension, that is, to avoid 
word-level comprehension or lexical matching, it may be useful to construct a test using the No-prev 
format. On the other hand, if the aim is to assess specific word-level comprehension, it may be more 
appropriate to provide an item preview. Assessing a broader construct that includes both of these abilities 
may require the use of more than one of the conditions described in this study. Thus, the decision about 
whether or not to provide an item preview should be made based on the construct that the test developer 
aims to assess. 
Limitations of the study should be noted. The test taker population was a fairly homogeneous group of 
Japanese EFL learners, and consequently the results may not generalize well to other populations. In 
addition, the sample size was rather small (N=206) for an IRT analysis, and because there were multiple 
items used to assess comprehension of one scene, the IRT assumption of item independence may not have 
been completely satisfied in the study (So, 2010). 
The findings of our study suggest that test developers should carefully consider how much information 
about items they want to provide to test takers prior to listening because the amount and form of 
information preview might affect which items students get right and which items they get wrong. These 
differences in difficulty can be attributed to various content aspects of the items, indicating the 
importance of considering these factors when constructing items for listening tests. Building on the 
findings of this study, it might be informative to construct an empirical study that specifically investigates 
the frequency of mention—and perhaps type of mention (e.g., exact mention or synonym)—and test form 
(e.g., amount of information preview available to test takers). A carefully designed study would also 
consider the effects of the placement of the item focus (i.e., its location in the listening input) in 
relationship to the frequency of mention. For example, a study could compare the assessment of content 
mentioned frequently in the first half of the listening input to content mentioned in the last half of the 
listening input. It might be informative to understand the influence of grammatical structures on the 
assessment of the listening construct. To that end, another follow-up study might consider the effects of 
manipulating syntactic structures to include specific grammatical forms such as passives, anaphors, and 
relative clauses in the input versus in the item options.

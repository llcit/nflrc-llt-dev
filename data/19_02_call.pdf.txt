Call for Papers for Action Research Column 
 
Editor: Greg Kessler 
Action-Research (AR) is a research methodology, which leads first to the understanding of the causes of 
a certain situation and then to producing change in it. Its focus is in solving a problem that has been 
identified by one individual, or a group of practitioners such as a school, an institution, or an organization. 
AR has developed as a way to broaden people’s knowledge and understanding of their own practice and 
of issues that affect the productivity and/or the quality of the work they do. The findings of AR are used 
as additional research data or as a way of developing some kind of action—intervention—in the 
environment being studied. 
The AR column in Language Learning & Technology serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners 
alike to disseminate the results of their projects and to consider the pedagogical implications of their 
research more closely. We strongly encourage teachers and/or teams of professionals who are addressing 
educational issues or challenges in their teaching environments to submit manuscripts for consideration. 
We are primarily interested in manuscripts that address the integration of technology and its potential in 
improving second/foreign language teaching and learning in a variety of contexts with different student 
populations. We are also interested in contributions that represent a wide spectrum of foreign languages, 
particularly the Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTLs). 
To submit articles for this new column, we encourage authors to consider the following guidelines for the 
format of their manuscripts: 
1) Identification of Problem Area 
2) Collection and Organization of Data 
3) Interpretation of Data 
4) Action Based on Data 
5) Assessment/Reflection of the Researcher 
Criteria for assessing manuscripts will include the following: 
• Adherence to principles of action research  
• Clearly articulated conceptual framework and connections to relevant literature 
• Thorough description of data collection and analysis procedures 
• Readability and originality 
• Potential implications for the second/foreign language classroom 
Guidelines for Authors:  
Articles should be no longer than 5,000 words (including references but not appendices). For specific 
guidelines, please refer to the submissions page http://llt.msu.edu/guidelines/

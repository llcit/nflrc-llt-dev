TABLETS FOR INFORMAL LANGUAGE LEARNING:
STUDENT USAGE AND ATTITUDES
Xiao-Bin Chen, South China University of Technology
Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), a relatively new area of CALL inquiry, is
gaining more and more attention from language educators with the development of new
mobile devices. Tablet computers—featuring high mobility, convenient network
connectivity, and smart application extendibility—are part of a wave of the latest mobile
inventions; how these new mobile devices enhance MALL and how students perceive
them as a language learning tool have yet to be broadly explored. This action research
project sought to investigate how students used tablet computers to learn English in
informal settings outside of class and how to foster more effective usage of the tablet for
independent language learning. The study shows that tablet computers are ideal tools for
creating an interactive, collaborative, and ubiquitous environment for language learning,
provided that the technological affordances of the device have been fully explored with the
students. This investigation also reveals that students have a generally favorable attitude
towards the usability, effectiveness, and satisfaction of tablet computers for MALL.

INTRODUCTION
The ubiquitous availability of portable devices, including mobile phones, laptops, tablets, and multimedia
players has changed foreign language instructional methods and learning strategies with today’s students
(Abdous, Camarena, & Facer, 2009), with mobile learning (m-learning) emerging as the next generation
of e-learning (Sharples, 2009). A new type of mobile device that is quickly gaining popularity and
language educators’ attention is the tablet computer, which features a large-size touch screen for
convenient operation, multimedia functions for sound and video playbacks, Wi-Fi/3G enabled network
for easy connectivity, as well as small size for easy portability. Because of its newness, the technological
affordances of this new type of device, especially how it can support foreign language learning and
instruction, have yet to be widely explored.
The present paper reports on an action research (AR) project that investigated how university students in
China used tablet computers to learn English in informal settings outside of class and how they could be
better guided to fully exploit the tablets’ functionalities for autonomous and collaborative foreign
language learning. Student attitudes towards the tablets’ usability and effectiveness, and these students’
satisfaction with this new language learning tool were also of interest to the author in this investigation.
M-learning, defined by Vavoula as “any sort of learning that happens when the learner is not at a fixed
predetermined location, or learning that happens when the learner takes advantage of the learning
opportunity offered by mobile technologies,” (2005, p. 11) has been found to be effective in improving
educational outcomes because it (a) improves access to education and (b) promotes learning that is
learner-centered, personalized, collaborative, situated, and ubiquitous (Valk, Rashid, & Elder, 2010). A
survey of the MALL literature reveals that the bulk of this research appears to make use of the nowconventional mobile technologies, such as mobile phones (Amer, 2010; Baleghizadeh & Oladrostam,
2010; Başoğlu & Akdemir, 2010; Reinders, 2010; Zhang, Song, & Burston, 2011; de Jong, Specht, &
Koper, 2010), PDAs (Chang & Hsu, 2011; Wong & Looi, 2010), and the mostly out-of-fashion laptopwith-stylus tablets (Lan, Sung, & Chang, 2007; Orden, 2006; Ozok, Benson, Chakraborty, & Norcio,
2008). However, there is a lack of research on how the latest pad tablets—led by Apple’s iPad series and
numerous Android-based models—can be utilized in the language learning arena. The present study is

further motivated by the desire to understand how the new mobile technology can foster the development
of independent learning skills in students’ daily informal learning environment, which is as important—if
not more so—than the formal learning space. It has been found that MALL has great potential to bridge
the gap between formal and informal learning (Bo-Kristensen, Ankerstjerne, Neutzsky-Wulff, & Schelde,
2009; Hsu, in press; Wong & Looi, 2010), but the nature of mobile learning can only be understood by
viewing its use in naturalistic settings other than the artificial environment of the classroom (Stockwell,
2010).
The study addresses the above issues by adopting Kemmis and McTaggart’s (1988) spiral framework of
action research (see Figure 1 below). Although the four phases of planning, action, observation, and
reflection in each iterative cycle of their framework have been criticized by some authors as being too
fixed and rigid (Burns, 2010) and other AR models have been put forward (see Koshy, 2005, p. 3 for a
discussion of other models), Kemmis and McTaggart’s model is still considered to be the most classic as
it “summarizes very succinctly the essential phases of the AR process” (Burns, 2010).
MOBILE ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING
Mobile assisted language learning is the formal or informal learning of a foreign language with the
assistance of mobile devices. It is a relatively new research area (Vavoula & Sharples, 2008), despite the
fact that people have now been using personal portable devices for some time. The major distinguishing
characteristic of MALL from traditional language learning is the mobility the former affords, in addition
to the possibilities of spatial and time shifts yielding increased learning opportunities (Kukulska-Hulme,
2009). This is to say, as access to mobile devices can be at any time and from any place—as long as
students carry their device—the time and space constraints of formal language learning can be greatly
reduced, offering more flexible informal learning opportunities.
Another distinguishing feature of MALL is its connectivity. Through the in-built GPRS, Wi-Fi, and 3G
Internet access, modern mobile devices provide language learners with opportunities to be involved in
meaningful real-context interactions, which are usually lacking in traditional language learning
environments, especially in informal out-of-class situations (cf., Bo-Kristensen et al., 2009; Vavoula,
2005). Consequently, language learning is no longer limited to one-way individual learning, but can be
expanded to a two- or multi-way collaborative learning (Lan et al., 2007; Chang & Hsu, 2011).
MALL may not only improve access to education, but it also facilitates alternative learning processes and
instructional methods (Valk et al., 2010). For instance, MALL has the potential to bridge the gap between
formal and informal learning spaces (Wong & Looi, 2010). Students in Wong and Looi’s study learned
the meaning and usage of new prepositions and idioms in the formal classroom setting, and then they
went out of the classroom to take photos illustrating the newly acquired words and idioms with networkenabled pocket PCs. They were further encouraged to carry the mobile phones home and take photos of
daily scenes to illustrate the idioms they had learned in class. These photos were then uploaded onto the
Web to be commented on by peers to encourage collaborative learning. It was concluded that the
combination of formal and informal learning fosters contextualized learning, productive outputs, and a
socio-constructivist acquisition of the target language. By synthesizing learning inside and outside of the
classroom, students are encouraged to take more responsibility for their learning, thus developing their
independent learning skills (Barrs, 2012) and benefitting their future studies.
The topics of MALL research exploiting various mobile technologies have been wide-ranging. Studies
with mobile phones have focused on fostering grammatical accuracy (Baleghizadeh & Oladrostam, 2010),
improving speech fluency (Kessler, 2010), learning vocabulary (Thornton & Houser, 2005), and
evaluating student preferences and attitudes towards MALL (Stockwell, 2007, 2010). PDAs have been
found effective in promoting intensive reading comprehension (Chang & Hsu, 2011) and creative learning
of idioms (Wong & Looi, 2010). Student and teacher perception of the usability (Ozok et al., 2008),

Language Learning & Technology

effectiveness (Demirbilek, 2010), and acceptance (Hsu, in press) of MALL are also topics of interest to
scholars of this field.
However, most MALL studies to date have mainly focused on transferring former classroom- or
computer-based contents onto the mobile platform, such as delivering materials previously used with
paper- or computer-based media, or developing trans-platform applications like mobile dictionaries,
quizzes, or survey tools. These studies simply consider mobile devices as a new means for content
delivery, rather than tools that will facilitate new learning. The collaborative and communicative
affordances of mobility and connectivity have not been fully exploited (Kukulska-Hulme & Shield,
2008). It is therefore necessary that MALL researchers “move beyond a superficial understanding of the
field and focus more on how mobility, accompanied by digital, location-aware technologies, changes
learning” (Kukulska-Hulme, 2009). This goal can be achieved by first investigating how mobile tools are
actually used by learners in the learning process, especially in naturalistic settings where the nature of
mobile learning is to be fully understood (Stockwell, 2010), and how learners perceive mobile devices as
tools to assist language learning. Only through a better understanding of the role MALL plays in the
language learning process can language instructors offer learners valuable guidance on how to better
utilize them to reach the learning goals.
THE PRESENT STUDY
The aim of this action research study was to investigate how students used tablet computers as a language
learning tool, especially in informal learning situations outside of the classroom. Special interest was
placed on the length of time, locations, activities, and student experiences involving the tablets, as well as
the perceived usability, effectiveness, and satisfaction of this mobile technology. A spiral model of AR
(Figure 1; see Kemmis & McTaggart, 1988) was adopted for this research project.

Figure 1. Kemmis and McTaggart’s (1988) Cyclical AR model, adapted from Burns (2010).
Participants
Participants of the study consisted of 10 freshmen English majors (four men and six women) from the
author’s university. They were randomly chosen by drawing lots from nearly 30 volunteers recruited from

an Intensive Reading class. A survey questionnaire (Appendix A) was administered to collect background
information concerning participants’ former experience with mobile devices, English levels, and
computer literacy.
Participants’ ages ranged from 17 to 20 years old (M = 18.8; SD = .92), and the participants were
intermediate English learners, according to the results of a placement test administered upon their arrival
at the university (M = 59.65 out of a perfect score of 100, SD = 6.36) and their self-reported English
proficiency (M = 2.7 on a five-point scale, SD = .48). Their self-rated computer skills were also
intermediate (M = 3, on a five-point scale, SD = .81).
A background survey also showed that while mobile phone ownership was universal (eight students
owned ordinary mobile phones; two had smart phones), only one participant claimed ownership of a
tablet, but he had never used it to learn a foreign language. All participants said that they had used their
mobile phones to learn English. Major language learning activities on the mobile phone included looking
up new words in e-dictionaries and listening to English audio. The majority of students (7 out of 10)
agreed that mobile technologies were useful for language learning because they were easily accessible
and very straightforward to use.
Procedure
A two-cycle procedure (see Figure 1) was followed to assess the students’ daily English learning
activities with the tablet. The main purpose of the first cycle was to understand how the participants used
tablet computers for informal learning of English outside of the classroom and the potential problems they
might encounter. In the second cycle, the author aimed at fostering more effective use of the tablet for
improved independent and collaborative learning.
Cycle 1, Plan and Action
On the first day of the study, students were each given a Teclast P85 tablet, a pad-like handheld computer
featuring an 8-inch touch screen, 8GB internal memory, Wi-Fi connection, a Webcam, and basic
audio/video functionalities. The Teclast P85 uses Google Android, the most popular operating system
specifically designed for mobile devices (“Mobile operating system,” 2012); accordingly, it is capable of
running any of the hundreds of thousands of applications developed for Android. Upon receiving the
tablets, the 10 participants were instructed on how to operate them. They were also told the purpose of the
study and asked to use the tablets mainly for English study. Participants were allowed to carry and use the
tablets whenever and wherever they wanted.
Cycle 1, Observe
Throughout the entire investigation, the participants were requested to fill in daily usage reports
(Appendix B), in which they kept note of their everyday experience with the tablets, including where, for
what purposes, and for how long they had used the tablets. They were also encouraged to document any
problems or comments concerning the tablets in their daily reports. In case a participant forgot to fill in
the daily report form, mobile phone text messages were sent every night at around 10 o’clock to remind
the participants of this task during the research cycles. The daily activity report forms were collected
weekly when the class met.
By the end of the first week of the study, the author and the participants met for a semi-structured group
interview, in which questions concerning the participants’ experiences with the tablets were asked.
Example questions included how the tablets were used to learn English, what advantages and
disadvantages the participants thought they had, problems they encountered and whether and how they
were solved, whether they considered tablets a useful tool for language learning, and so forth. The
interview lasted for about 30 minutes and was audio-recorded for subsequent analysis.
Analysis of the data collected from the first week’s study gave the researcher new insights into how tablet

computers were used by the participants and the problems they experienced with the device. It was found
that most participants used their tablets almost every day, especially on weekdays. They spent a daily
average of 2.39 hours (SD = 1.42) using the tablets, mostly in the dormitory (M = 1.95, SD = 1.45). The
university library (M = .36, SD = .79), classrooms (M = .05, SD = .18), and other locations (M = .03,
SD = .15), including student canteens and the subway, were also places where the tablets were frequently
used. The time spent on different activities on the tablets varied from person to person, but English
learning was the activity that participants spent the most time on. An average of .61 hours (SD = .62) was
spent daily on learning English with the device. However, this was only one fourth of the total time with
the tablets: most tablet activities were not directly related to English learning. The tablets were also used
for surfing the Internet, reading E-books, and entertainment activities, such as games, music, and movies.
Some participants even used them to shop and communicate with friends on line. Although the purpose of
these activities was not language learning, some students claimed in a later interview that a lot of them
were done in English. Table 1 summarizes the average hours each participant spent daily on different
activities in the first week.

Qualitative data from the daily reports and the group interview revealed the advantages of the tablets as a
mobile-assisted language learning tool because of their easy-to-operate touch screens, fast Wi-Fi
connection, expandable application installation, and convenient portability. Participant commentary
includes the following:
Today in the library, I used the faster connection to download some apps and resources.
When I was in the dorm, I slept in the bed watching the CNN student news and two
episodes of American TV series that I just downloaded. While I was reading, I also used
the tablet computer to look up new vocabulary.
In the afternoon, I read English E-books with the tablet and downloaded other books on
the Internet. I like reading E-books and it’s convenient for me to finish my reading task
with the tablet computer.
Did reading comprehension exercise, use the app “Daily English Communication 1001”
and “business English”. The materials are all in the tablet, which are convenient to use.
Today I spent 3 hours to use the tablet computer in the library. I downloaded many
English-studying systems, including some English E-books and listenings, which I think is
very useful for me to do English listening and reading.
Anecdotally, one student claimed that the actual act of using the tablet was a learning experience:
Today I changed the language from Chinese to the United States English, maybe be
helpful for learning new words, such as “install”, “browser”…
Despite the fact that most participants found the tablets to be an effective tool for language learning, they
also reported some problems, which mainly concerned system operation, Wi-Fi availability, and how to
evaluate language learning applications. For example, some students felt it inconvenient to type by
tapping the touch screen because they were more used to using physical keyboards. Others did not know

how to open MS Office files on the tablet. Typical complaints from the participants include:
The Wi-Fi is not spreaded everywhere, so it’s not as convenient as I have thought… I used
1.5 hours to download softwares and another 1.5 hours to try to login in my e-mail box to
download some documents. But finally I failed because of the poor network.
…there may be something wrong with it [the tablet] because sometimes I can’t open some
Apps and the tablet can’t work, then I need to restart up the computer.
I have planned to use those softwares which are helpful to English study, but most
softwares need connecting the Internet. So I played some small games and copied some Ebooks. I think if there is no Wi-Fi, the table [tablet] computer only can be used as an Ebook, a dictionary, a game player, or a MP4.
Lack of self-control was another factor preventing effective usage of the tablet for language learning:
I can’t help being tempted to play games, though I haven’t download any game, study
hasn’t come to my mind.
Cycle 1, Reflect
Reports on how the participants used their tablets and the problems they encountered during this process
urged the researcher to take measures to help them better utilize these devices for language learning.
Results of the first cycle’s observation stage revealed that the participants spent little time for interactive
activities on their tablets. Most of the tablet activities were carried out individually, not making full use of
the technology’s connectivity for interactive and collaborative learning, which is essential to language
learning. Additionally, lack of knowledge about the tablets’ system and which applications could be used
for learning which aspects of the English language prevented the participants from effectively using the
devices to learn English in informal settings. Simply providing learners with the latest mobile tool did not
automatically result in more effective learning since there was no detailed instruction on the use of the
technology. This resonates with Hubbard’s (2004) urge for CALL instructors to take responsibilities in
helping learners “make informed decisions about how to use computer resources effectively to meet their
learning objectives” (p. 51).
Cycle 2, Revised Plan
By analyzing the data collected in the first cycle, the author came up with a revised plan, the purposes of
which were twofold: (a) to guide students on the technological affordances of the tablet, and (b) to foster
interactive and collaborative learning.
The first step was to deal with the problems that occurred during the first week of the study. These were
mostly technical problems due to system limitations or lack of understanding of the tablet computers. For
example, some participants wanted to know how to copy files from a USB memory to the tablet, how to
install and uninstall applications, where downloaded files were stored, and how to deal with system
failures, among other things. The author collected all the questions the participants asked and composed a
Q&A document for them. The document was shared online with the participants, who later reported that
most of their technical problems had been solved.
The second step was to create a mobile platform for communication and collaboration between
participants. Since the study focused on how tablets will help foster learner autonomy or independent
learning in informal settings, the author decided to let the students take responsibility for their own
learning. The instructor adopted an assisting role. Consequently, the 10 participants were divided into
three groups, each of which was assigned to research on some aspects of tablet-assisted language
learning: (a) listening and speaking, (b) reading and writing, and (c) real life language usage. These
groups were required to review possible apps for these aspects and design learning activities that might

Xiao-Bin Chen

Tablets for Informal Language Learning

involve other learners. The second week of the study was reserved for these tasks.
Cycle 2, Action
Another meeting was called by the end of the second week to discuss possible methods for creating an
interactive and collaborative learning environment. The three groups of participants contributed
importantly to the design of the following activities:
•

creating an English Weixin (Micro-message) group to allow for multi-user
synchronous/asynchronous audio and text chats. Weixin is a mobile application developed by
China’s biggest instant messaging service provider Tencent. This application is widely used by
Chinese smart phone users because of its convenience and low cost. It runs well on the Android
tablet. The Weixin interactive group provides a good way to practice writing, listening, and
speaking on the tablets because it enables meaningful interactions with other learners.

•

using Weibo (Micro-blog)—Twitter’s Chinese counterpart—to share interesting stories and
thoughts in English. Before the study, most students updated their Weibo in Chinese because
most of their followers spoke Chinese only. As English majors, the participants wished to use in
daily life the foreign language they were learning, but were afraid of not being understood by
others. The ten participants decided to follow each other’s micro-blog so as to create an online
English circle for themselves with the help of the tablets, which allowed them to share their
stories and thoughts anytime, anywhere. They even established the rule that only English could be
used to write and comment on micro-blog entries.

•

reviewing major mobile apps and recommending two E-book reader series—10000+ Free
eBooks Reader and Go Book, both featuring thousands of downloadable free E-books—to
practice reading comprehension. Another recommended application that combines listening and
reading practice is Langren Tingshu (Audio Books for Lazy People), which also broadly captured
the interest of the participants. The large screen of the tablets, its mobility, and multimedia
functionality made the device a perfect tool for E-books and audio books.

Cycle 2, Observe
In the following week, the participants carried out the activities they designed while at the same time they
continued logging their daily activities. The mean length of time participants spent on the tablets for
different activities after the implementation of the revised plan was calculated, as shown in Table 2.

During the third week of the study, the average time participants spent daily with their tablets was 1.68
hours (SD = 1.16), which was significantly shorter compared to that of the first week according to an
independent-samples t-test (p < .01). One possible reason was that their curiosity towards the tablet was
wearing off. Another reason might have been the approach of final examinations, which were scheduled
two weeks after the study. However, the proportion of time spent learning English increased by 11.4%
from the first week’s 25.5% (.61 out of a daily total of 2.39 hours using the tablet were spent in learning
English) to 36.9% (.62 out of 1.68 hours) in the third week. This indicates that more guidance on how to
better utilize the tablet for language learning has a positive effect on increasing the percentage of time

spent in language learning with mobile technology.
The author joined and participated in most of the activities the participants designed. Some students were
quite active in the tablet-created online environment. They frequently used the audio and text chatting in
Weixin to tell other participants about their current activities, respond to peers’ entries, and discuss
coursework. The following is the scripts excerpt of a Weixin audio chat session between two participants
and the author:
Participant 1: Could you give me an evaluation about my presentation today? I really want
to know what do you think… think of it.
Teacher: Hello, Wang Ying, I think your presentation today was quite good, but you
seemed a little bit nervous when giving the presentation.
Participant 2: How about mine?
Teacher: I think if you could show us more pictures, it would be better. You talked about
mountain climbing with the other members of the Fresher Club [an environmental
protection group], so maybe you did something special while climbing the mountain, like
something related to environmental protection. I think the audience might also be
interested in that.
On the micro-blog platform, many students started writing and commenting with the tablet in English
(see Figure 2 for examples of such micro-blogs). They all seemed to understand how important it was to
create a collaborative learning environment, so micro-blog entries encouraging each other to write in
English can often be seen, resulting in more and more English entries and feedback.
Qualitative comments from participants’ daily reports also reflected the effectiveness of tablet-enabled
interactive and collaborative English learning:
I downloaded two softwares which Los introduced in our discussion. They are 10000 freeebook reader and go book. There are many kinds of English books on the Internet and we
can make good use of them.
Today I find some new applications about English. After using the tablet computer for
learning English for some time, I do think that my English is better. It’s mainly in glossary
and how to use English.
I use it to look up new words in the dictionary and use some time to scan others’ Weibo
and give some comments.
Today morning, I spent 0.5 hours to listen to the VOA stories. And afternoon about 6
o’clock, I spent about 1.5 hour in Weixin. So I think today I have got much input. And I
also use it to listen English song, I feel so well.
Today like usual I try some English learning applications. For using much time, I found
it’s helpful to use tablet computer for English learning.
Cycle 2, Reflect
The revised plan in the second cycle successfully addressed the problems arising from the first cycle. The
technical problems the participants encountered were solved by sending them the Q&A document. A
collaborative environment for MALL was created to allow for more meaningful interactions, which was
vital to language learning. However, student performance on this environment varied. Some were active
and contributed a lot to the building of the environment, while others were more reluctant to express
themselves in English. Those who played active roles in the MALL interactive environment felt that they
benefited a lot, as was noted in the above comments. For the less-active participants, the reasons behind

Language Learning & Technology

27

their reluctance need to be explored further, so as to create a more supportive learning environment for
them. This will result in a new cycle of research, which is beyond the scope of this investigation.

Figure 2. Micro-blogging in English with the Tablet
Attitude Survey on Tablets for Language Learning
Understanding tablet-based MALL is not complete without assessing students’ attitudes towards this
technology. Sharples (2009) proposed that a useful way to approach the evaluation of MALL technology
is to address its usability (will it work?), effectiveness (is it enhancing learning?) and satisfaction (is it
liked?). Following Sharples’s suggestions and Davis’s (1993) Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), an
attitude survey questionnaire (Appendix C) was composed to assess students’ perceptions of the usability,
effectiveness, and satisfaction with the tablets for language learning. The survey, which consisted of 30
statements eliciting student opinions on a five-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly
Agree), was administered after the participants had been using the tablets for four weeks. Mean ratings of
each statement are given in Appendix C as well.
In general, participants of the study thought that tablet computers were easy to use, effective for language
learning, and they were quite satisfied with the mobile technology to enhance their language learning and
performance. These results suggest that tablet computers are a potentially promising tool for MALL.
DISCUSSION
This action research investigated how students used tablet computers for informal language learning and
their attitudes towards the new mobile technology. It was found that simply providing students with the
mobile device did not result in its effective usage in language learning. Learners need to be properly
guided not only technologically, but also methodologically. Some students may have a lack of necessary
knowledge and experience to solve problems in the process of adopting new technologies. As a
consequence, creating an easily accessible supportive environment in which expert and peer advice can be
consulted is vital for MALL. Instructor guidance on how the mobile technology can be better utilized for

Language Learning & Technology

28

Xiao-Bin Chen

Tablets for Informal Language Learning

language learning in terms of activity design and collaboration is also essential, since students may not be
aware of the technological affordances of the new technology, the cognitive underpinnings of language
learning or how they could be combined to foster competence. This finding echoes Yu, Sun, and Chang’s
(2010) argument that it is optimum for the instructor to manifest to the learners a new system’s
technological affordances, even though their attitude towards new technology is usually positive.
A further finding is that students should be provided with more opportunities to take responsibility for
their informal learning outside of the classroom with network-enabled tablets. As they take control of
their learning experiences, learners usually develop their own learning strategies (Amer, 2010). Studentdesigned activities and self-chosen learning topics are more involving than a teacher’s assignments,
because students usually choose things that interest themselves. These activities can also involve peers for
collaborative learning, as was shown in this study. Learner collaboration has been found to contribute to
students’ sense of ownership and autonomy (Kessler, 2009), because they may feel that their
contributions are valued and they also value those of the other group members (Kessler, Bikowski, &
Boggs, 2012), the result of which is more contributions and more learning. Learner collaboration was
made more prevalent with the help of the highly portable tablet computers. Students reported using them
for various collaborative learning activities in different locations, especially where Wi-Fi was available.
Finally, the study found that students’ attitudes towards the usability, effectiveness, and satisfaction of
tablet computers as a tool for MALL were quite positive, which is similar to what other MALL studies
have found (e.g., Başoğlu & Akdemir, 2010; Ozok et al., 2008). This is a good sign for language teachers
and MALL practitioners. It indicates that language learners, especially those who grew up as the so-called
“digital natives” (Prensky, 2001), are willing to make use of mobile technologies for their studies,
opening a whole new world of possibilities for language teaching and learning. Tablets, as well as other
mobile technologies await our further exploration to better serve both language teachers and students.
CONCLUSIONS
Participants in this study used tablet computers to learn English in a tablet-enabled interactive and
collaborative environment they created. It can be concluded that tablet computers, as well as other mobile
technologies, are ideal tools to foster learner autonomy and ubiquitous learning in informal settings,
provided that their technological affordances have been carefully studied and clearly manifested to
student users, who usually have a positive attitude towards the usability, effectiveness, and satisfaction of
mobile technologies as language learning tools, because they are the generation that has grown up using
these technologies.
Despite the contributions of this study to MALL, it is not free from limitations and caveats. One of the
limitations of the study is its possible lack of generalizability. The investigation was carried out with a
limited number of participants. Although the results were revealing and of practical value to the author
and his institute, caution must be taken when the results are to be generalized to other settings. This
caveat may hold with most action research projects, since this research genre predominantly investigates
the practical problems related to a specific language learning issue within a local context.
Another limitation of the study is the absence of further cycles to investigate the issues left unexplored
from these research cycles. The Cyclical Model of AR the study adopted is an infinite spiral, with lower
level cycles solving problems arising from upper level ones. Due to limited resources, the current study
did not explore additional concerns, for example, how to create a more supportive mobile learning
environment with tablet computers for students who are less active thus less willing to express themselves
in English. The long-term effect of tablet assisted language learning is also an issue that the present study
did not investigate but one which is worthy of exploration.

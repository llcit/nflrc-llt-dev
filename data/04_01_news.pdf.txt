University of Hawai‘i National Foreign Language Resource 
Center (NFLRC)  
Less commonly taught languages, particularly those of Asia and the Pacific, are the focus of the 
University of Hawai`i National Foreign Language Resource Center. 
The NFLRC proudly presents its 2000 NFLRC SUMMER INSTITUTES! The first workshop 
COMPUTER-BASED TESTS FOR LESS COMMONLY TAUGHT LANGUAGES (June 12-23) will 
incorporate training in language test construction and evaluation and examine the role of technology in 
assessment, focusing on Web and computer-based testing (self-assessment, proficiency, achievement) for 
less commonly taught languages. The second workshop,  PERFORMANCE-BASED CHINESE 
LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION (July 10-21), conducted in tandem with summer Chinese courses at the 
University of Hawai'i at Manoa, focuses on strategies for instruction and testing to enhance learner 
performance on communicative tasks in the 4 skills. Deadline for application for both workshops is 
February 1, 2000. 
In addition to engaging in research and materials development projects and conducting summer institutes 
for language professionals, the UH NFLRC makes available a wide variety of publications on Center 
projects and programs. 
Advanced learners of Chinese and Korean may celebrate the release of KAN NA! and HANGUL-RO 
BOJA! on CD-ROM. The lessons are based on authentic materials (i.e., materials created by native 
speakers for native speakers) and include newspaper articles, personal letters, video interviews, 
informational brochures, and television commercials. The activities are designed to activate in the learner 
the strategies used by native speakers to comprehend text and video. In addition, the popular Chinese 
Language Video Clips is now available on cross-platform CD-ROM. 
If you haven't visited our Foreign Language Multimedia Software site yet, be sure to check in. At this site 
you may search for multimedia instructional materials by language, find out about authoring tools, view a 
selected bibliography of CALL evaluations, and consult criteria for preparing your own software 
evaluations. 
Other new publications from the NFLRC include a number of additions to the NFLRC NetWorks 
collection of online publications. 
You may contact the NFLRC at nflrc@hawaii.edu.

Apprentissage des Langues et Systèmes d'Information et de 
Communication (ALSIC) 
 
ALSIC (Language Learning and Information and Communication Systems) is an electronic journal in 
French for researchers and practitioners in fields related to applied linguistics, didactics, 
psycholinguistics, educational sciences, computational linguistics, and computer science. 
The journal gives priority to papers from the French-speaking community and/or in French, but it also 
regularly invites papers in other languages so as to strengthen scientific and technical exchanges between 
linguistic communities that too often remain separate. The editorial board of ALSIC invites you to contact 
them for any prospective contributions at the following electronic address: alsic@lifc.univ-fcomte.fr. 
 
The Australian Technology Enhanced Language Learning Consortium 
(ATELL) 
 
Contacts: Dr Mike Levy, The University of Queensland (mlevy@lingua.arts.uq.edu.au) 
 Prof. Roly Sussex, The University of Queensland (sussex@lingua.arts.uq.edu.au) 
 
ATELL is an informal collaboration of Australian language teachers involved in technology-enhanced 
language learning and teaching. 
 
It has recently been moved to The University of Queensland, where Dr. Mike Levy and Professor Roly 
Sussex are developing the concept in collaboration with Mr. Greg Dabelstein, coordinator of the CALL 
special interest group of the Association of Modern Language Teachers' Associations of Australia 
(AFMTLA). We intend to establish a network of complementary and collaborating resources for teachers 
and learners in the TELL domain in schools and tertiary institutions. 
 
There will be a Web site, which will include information, collaboration and resources such as: 
 •  a register of Australian TELL experts 
 •  links to other sites with TELL-related information and materials 
 •  links to reviews of hardware, software, courseware 
 •  a section for FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

where less commonly taught languages are taught throughout the country; listservs for teachers of less 
commonly taught languages and immersion educators; a working paper series; conferences and 
workshops; and a battery of instruments in French, German, and Spanish for assessing learners' 
proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening at the Intermediate-Low level on the ACTFL 
scale. Check out these and other CARLA resources on the CARLA website at http://carla.acad.umn.edu.

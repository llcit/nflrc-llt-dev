Language Learning Social Network Sites (LLSNSs) have attracted millions of users 
around the world. However, little is known about how people participate in these sites and 
what they learn from them. This study investigated learners’ attitudes, usage, and progress 
in a major LLSNS through a survey of 4,174 as well as 20 individual case studies. The 
study hints at the potential of LLSNSs, given the generally positive regard participants 
have for the site, but it also shows its limitations, since most learners drop out or show 
only limited gains. The study suggests that if online education is to play a positive role in 
the teaching and learning of English and other languages, learners will need support, 
guidance, and well-structured activities to ensure the kinds of participation and linguistic 
interaction that can lead to success.

INTRODUCTION 
Language learning social network sites (LLSNSs), online communities specifically aimed at encouraging 
collaboration between language learners (Harrison & Thomas, 2009), bring together opportunities for 
students to receive structural tutorials and deploy what they learn in authentic communication with native 
speakers around the world. The emergence of LLSNSs thus brings together two important features of 
Computer Assisted Language Learning: instruction and communication. 
A number of start-ups and academic institutions have launched specialized websites for language 
learning, including Livemocha1, iTalki, Lang-8, Hello-Hello, Duolingo, and Palabea. Livemocha, for 
example, provides both language-learning materials and opportunities to practice the user’s target 
language with more than 13 million international users. Its approach aligns with the community-of-
practice theory (Wenger, 1998), according to which learning occurs when a group of people who share a 
particular interest interact regularly. Wenger further suggests three essential components for a community 
of practice: a shared domain of interest, mutual engagement within the community, and a shared 
repertoire of resources and practices. Users of LLSNSs have a shared domain of interest: language 
learning. The peer-review feature of most of these sites may promote mutual engagement, as users 
collectively engage in discussion to achieve their goals. The provision of feedback to other site members 
is also indicative of a shared repertoire of resources and practices, in the sense that a given member’s 
knowledge of their own native language represents expertise that is valuable to other members who are 
seeking to learn that language.

LANGUAGE LEARNING THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORK SITES 
Early research on language learning on both LLSNSs and other social-network sites (SNSs) has focused 
on attitudes, usage, and progress. 
Attitudes 
Though users may have concerns about privacy and surveillance on SNSs, according to Vie (2007), they 
do not fear sharing and exchanging information. Chen’s (2013) study illustrates how attitudes towards 
Facebook affected the literacy practices of two international students, Cindy and Jane (pseudonyms), in 
the United States. Cindy equated being literate in English to mastering academic English, so the use of 
Facebook was not important to her due to its informality, nor did it appeal to her for socializing which she 
preferred to do in her native language. In contrast, Jane perceived Facebook to be a welcoming space for 
English learners and therefore used it to construct her new identity as an experienced user of English as a 
foreign language. 
Though users generally seem to have positive, if often complex, attitudes towards using SNSs, user 
attitudes to LLSNSs remain unclear. Stevenson and Liu (2010) documented both positive and negative 
user attitudes towards three LLSNSs. On the one hand, their participants generally reported excitement 
about learning from native speakers. On the other hand, they were hesitant about how LLSNSs were 
meant to be used, with one respondent commenting that Livemocha “should be built for learning a 
language, not for finding others for the purpose of establishing social relationships” (p. 249). Other users 
also expressed concerns about the quality of the feedback that other users provided. 
Usage 
Regarding the use of SNSs among non-native speakers of these sites’ principal languages, several studies 
highlight the importance of socialization. Mitchell (2012) proposes that learners of English should use 
Facebook to help acclimatize themselves to college life, build friendships with English native speakers, 
and experiment with the language. Vie (2007) also suggested that SNSs provide a space for socialization 
in which learners are exposed to authentic language used for diverse social purposes. 
At least two studies suggest that language learners’ use of SNSs decreases over time. Chen’s (2013) 
above-mentioned participants demonstrated decreased participation on Facebook over time, as measured 
by the number of status updates and other postings. Stevenson and Liu (2010) reported that 54% of their 
participants used Babbel for less than one month, and 26% used it for only one to three months. 
Progress 
Prior studies of SNSs investigate three aspects of learning progress: identity construction and 
development, socialization and pragmatics, and language improvement. 
Identity construction and development 
Considerable attention has been paid to identity construction and development in the second language 
(L2) as an indicator of learning progress on SNSs. From her observation of two multilingual writers, 
Chen (2013) concluded that SNSs empower users to navigate across languages, cultures, and identities. 
Similarly, research by Blattner and Fiori (2011), Klimanova and Dembovskaya (2013), and Mills (2011) 
supports the notion that SNS use helps learners construct their L2 identity and build a relationship with 
the target culture. 
Socialization and pragmatics 
Several studies suggest that social interaction on SNSs helps students to develop pragmatic competence. 
Vie (2007) documented how using MySpace and Facebook improved students’ rhetorical awareness. 
Chen’s (2013) case study illustrated the potentials of using Facebook for acquiring pragmatic use in 
Lin Chin-Hsi, Mark Warschauer, and Robert Blake Language Learning through Social Networks 
 
Language Learning & Technology 126 
English. Similarly, Blattner and Fiori (2009, 2011) studied learners taking an intermediate Spanish course 
and found that, through the use of Facebook, these students developed socio-pragmatic competence in 
areas such as greetings and leave-takings over the course of a semester. 
Language improvement 
Some studies have found association between SNS use and improvement in new literacies and language 
skills (e.g., Lee, 2006; Mills, 2011), and others have focused on non-standard uses of language in online 
interactions (e.g., Chen, 2013; Lee, 2006). Stevenson and Liu (2010) reported that users of Babbel 
perceived progress in vocabulary as well as increased confidence in using the target language. Mills 
(2011) used Facebook in a French classroom and found that this fostered an interactive community for 
communication, interaction, and discussions. Lee (2006) also reported that the frequency of L2 learners’ 
participation on SNSs appeared to have a positive impact on their oral proficiency, vocabulary 
acquisition, and syntactic complexity. While the findings from Lee’s study seemed encouraging, she also 
reported non-standard use of language forms among her participants, with Korean heritage language 
learners choosing to use non-standard orthography in Korean to express their affiliation with a particular 
subculture. 
LLSNSs represent an attempt to take the potential of SNSs a step further, providing users with more 
specific instructional resources and more targeted opportunities for L2 communication. Such sites have 
reached tens of millions of people in recent years. But what impact have they had on learning? We 
investigated three broad questions to address this issue: 
1. Attitudes: What were users’ attitudes toward L2 learning on a large LLSNS? 
2. Usage: What patterns of individual usage emerged from LLSNS participation? 
3. Progress: How much did individual LLSNS users think they learned? What actual L2 
improvement appeared to take place? 
METHODS 
Context 
This study focused on Livemocha (see Figure 1), a major LLSNS with the highest traffic among its 
competitors in 20122 (Alexa, 2012), more than 16 million international users in 2013 (Livemocha, 2013), 
and a purported growing impact on language learning (Jee & Park, 2009; Liaw, 2011). After users create 
a personal profile on the site, they choose the language they wish to study. More than 160 hours of 
language-learning materials are available for free in each of 38 languages. These materials are tailored to 
beginner and intermediate levels and include reading, writing, listening, and speaking exercises. Once 
users complete a lesson, they are asked to post their speaking and writing exercises so that others can 
review them and provide comments. Users can also find language-exchange partners, add them as friends, 
and give and receive tutoring using voice- or text-based chat. There are two types of reward points 
granted by the site: study points, which users earn for completing free courses, and tutor points, which are 
earned for tutoring others, providing comments, and creating online flashcards. To encourage user 
interaction, users are required to obtain a certain number of tutor points to unlock all exercises in the free 
courses. Badges are also provided to incentivize and confirm accomplishment, with different types of 
badges awarded to users who complete certain tasks, such as offering comments to others.3 In addition to 
free language-learning materials, Livemocha provides premium courses for a fee.4 
Data collection 
Data for the study included a survey of 4,174 Livemocha users as well as interviews and document 
analysis from 20 case-study participants.

Survey 
The researchers developed a 23-item survey, for which the target participants were 18 years old or above. 
It was made available on Livemocha in English, Chinese, Spanish, and Portuguese—languages spoken by 
84% of the participants on the site—from April to June 2009 and required approximately 20 minutes to 
complete.  
 
Figure 1. Livemocha home page (legacy version as of 2011) 
Before conducting the study, we asked Livemocha representatives if they could help us post our survey 
on their site, and they agreed to do so. During the survey period, people who accessed the site and who 
spoke any of the four survey languages were randomly exposed to a banner advertisement near the top of 
the page inviting them to take the survey in the language they spoke. A target of at least 1,000 responses 
was set for each language-version of the survey. For the Chinese, English, and Spanish versions this goal 
was surpassed in three months. The Portuguese survey was made available for an additional four months, 
but still did not meet the target; it was removed when no additional responses were received over a final 
two-week period (See Table 1). 
Case study 
In order to provide a focused look at one segment of Livemocha users, a group of case-study participants 
who had a particular language background (Chinese) and who were studying a particular foreign language 
(English) were recruited from among the survey participants. These languages were chosen due to their 
prominence: English is the most widely studied foreign language around the world, and Chinese speakers 
represent a notably high proportion of people studying it (Wei & Su, 2012). The choice of this particular 
pair of languages also matched the lead author’s language skills. Among the more than 1,300 Chinese-
speaking survey participants, 120 met study criteria of (a) studying English, (b) having used Livemocha 
for at least two months, and (c) agreeing to be interviewed. These 120 survey participants were invited to

become case-study participants also, and of the 48 who agreed to do so, 20 were selected randomly. We 
then asked these 20 individuals for permission to access their data on Livemocha. None of the case-study 
participants had purchased premium courses on the site. The average age of the case-study participants 
was 27.7 years old (SD = 8.93), and 16 participants were females. 
All 20 case-study participants were interviewed once either via phone or an instant messaging platform 
(depending on their preference) for approximately an hour and asked detailed questions about their usage 
of Livemocha and their experiences on the site. The interviews were semi-structured and had eighteen 
questions. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed (in the case of phone interviews), or 
archived (in the case of instant messaging). 
Exercises 
Before interviewing each case-study participant, the researchers manually retrieved all the public 
information on that participant’s profile, including number of friends, list of courses they had enrolled in, 
writing exercises, and all the responses to their exercises that had been posted by other users. All writing 
exercises submitted prior to December 31, 2011 were manually documented. In all, we retrieved 253 
writing and 275 speaking exercises. The writing exercises were part of the courses the participants were 
enrolled in; a typical prompt for such exercises would be to ask learners to describe something (e.g., 
“What did you do today?”) using the vocabulary, grammar, and content they had learned from a course. 
Writing exercises were used to examine site usage, generate specific interview questions about 
individuals’ experience of such usage, and examine individuals’ progress (i.e., language accuracy and 
syntactic complexity) over time. 
Measures 
Learner Background 
Our survey collected individual background data including respondents’ self-reported age, gender, 
income level, education, linguistic background, and target language. The participants’ socioeconomic 
status (SES) was measured through both income and education (Krieger, Williams, & Moss, 1997). 
Linguistic background was defined as a participant’s main language, as per their survey responses. 
Target Language Proficiency 
Proficiency in the target language was self-reported by individuals in the survey on a scale of 1-3, with 1 
being beginner and 3 being advanced. The scale was chosen because it corresponded to levels in their 
profile on Livemocha. 
Attitudes toward the Site 
Users’ attitudes toward the site were measured by four survey items on a scale of 1-5, with 1 indicating 
strong disagreement and 5 strong agreement with the statement presented. A sample item from this 
section of the survey is, “I feel more comfortable communicating with native speakers on Livemocha than 
in face-to-face communication.” 
Goals 
This item measured the target proficiency that participants hoped to attain by using Livemocha. The scale 
ranged from 1 (basic proficiency) to 4 (advanced proficiency). 
Learning Hours 
Learning hours were assessed via two self-reported variables: average hours spent studying on Livemocha 
per week, and average hours per week spent studying the target language outside of Livemocha.

Usage 
To investigate usage over time, we examined exercise submissions by 20 case-study participants. This 
document type was chosen as it was the only site feature with time stamps. The observation period for a 
given case-study participant started at the time they signed up with Livemocha and ended on December 
31, 2011. The discontinuation of exercise submission was used as a measure of attrition. The criteria for 
determining discontinuance of site usage were as follows: 1) if an individual never submitted any 
exercises after registration on the site, his or her “failure” date was set to four months after registration; 2) 
if an individual did not submit an exercise within four months of his or her previous submission, or 
submitted an exercise but beyond the four-month threshold, his or her failure date was set to the previous 
submission date plus four months. The threshold was approximately the average number of days from the 
previous submission (Mean = 35.4) plus one standard deviation (SD = 88). Since users tended to submit 
multiple exercises on the same day, same-day submissions by the same individual were counted as a 
single submission when calculating the means and the standard deviation. 
Perceived Progress 
Perceived progress was determined using survey data. The survey item covering overall perceived 
progress was on a scale of 1–4, with 1 indicating that the participants felt they had learned nothing, and 4 
that they had learned a large amount. Items covering perceived progress in specific skills were ranked on 
a scale of 1–3, with 1 indicating that the site was not helpful for acquiring or improving the skill, and 3 
that it was very helpful. 
Progress 
Two aspects of language development were examined for all writing exercises submitted by the 
participants: language accuracy and syntactic complexity. We used errors per T-unit (E/T) and error-free 
T-units (EFTs), as they normally are related to holistic ratings and short-term change (Wolfe-Quintero, 
Inagaki, & Kim, 1998). T-unit, or minimal terminable unit, refers to an independent clause and its 
dependent clause (Hunt, 1966). For example, “There was a man next door, and he was a teacher” has two 
T-units, and “There was a man next door who was a teacher” has one T-unit. There is no clear definition 
in the literature of what constitutes an error when calculating E/T and EFTs (Polio, 1997), so, in the 
current study, we used the sum of mechanical errors (i.e., capitalization and punctuation), lexical errors 
(i.e., spelling and word-choice), and grammatical errors (i.e., agreement and syntax). We used two coders 
for this data: a graduate student who had been an English teacher for more than 10 years, and an 
undergraduate who is a native English speaker. All disagreements that arose between the two coders 
regarding errors were discussed until they were resolved to the mutual satisfaction of both parties. 
In terms of syntactic complexity, we used clauses per T-unit. Clauses are structures with a subject and a 
finite verb (Polio, 1997), including independent, adverbial, adjective, and nominal clauses. A value of 2 
for clauses per T-unit means that the T-unit contains one independent clause and one other type of clause. 
Several studies have shown that clauses per T-unit is a robust measure, as it generally increases in a linear 
relationship to proficiency level, and is not affected by the task (Wolfe-Quintero, et al., 1998). 253 
English writing exercises were coded to evaluate if there was any improvement in syntactic complexity 
and language accuracy over time. 
Data Analysis 
Stata 13 was used to conduct all elements of the quantitative analysis. To answer the first research 
question, regarding attitudes, descriptive statistics and open-ended questions from the survey were 
analyzed for evidence of participants’ attitudes toward the site. 
To answer the second research question, descriptive statistics and survival analysis of the writing 
exercises submitted by the case-study participants were analyzed for evidence of site use. Survival

Language Learning & Technology  131 
analysis is a type of statistical analysis commonly used to estimate the odds of death/failure, or the length 
of time remaining until death/failure, in biological organisms and mechanical systems. In other words, the 
results of survival analysis will provide information on patterns and risks of a specific event over time 
(Singer & Willett, 1991); it avoids many of the statistical problems associated with other techniques 
because it treats time as the outcome (MacCullagh & Nelder, 1991). 
To answer the third research question, regarding progress, we first used descriptive statistics derived from 
the survey to analyze student self-perceived progress. We then fit a two-level individual growth model 
using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) with maximal likelihood estimates (Singer & Willett, 2003) to 
examine language accuracy and syntactic complexity from the participants’ writing exercises. HLM is a 
type of regression model used to account for correlated errors in nested data structures (such as students 
from different schools and measures taken at different time points). As compared to multiple regression, 
HLM provides a more accurate estimation with larger standard errors, because the latter method considers 
the sources of statistical error more rigorously (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). The equation is as follows: 
Level 1: Progressij = π0j + π1j Submissionij + Ɛij  (equation 1) 
Level 2: π0j = β00 + β01Proficiencyj + β02Xj + u0j 
π1j = β10 + β11Proficiencyj + β12kXj + u1j 
In this equation, the dependent variable is learning outcomes (i.e., language accuracy and syntactic 
complexity) by participant i at submission j. Level 1 describes within-participant variation, reflecting the 
language accuracy and syntactic complexity of work submitted at different times by the same person. Our 
model used the time elapsed between registration and submission as the time variable; the second and 
later submissions were treated as opportunities for improvement in language accuracy and syntactic 
complexity, even if such submissions occurred many days after the user registered on the site or made 
their last submission. Level 2 explains between-participant variation. The participant-level covariates 
included participants’ proficiency level in the target language; and X, which consisted of age, gender, 
years of education, income, hours spent learning weekly (on and off Livemocha), and number of friends 
on the site. 
In addition to the quantitative data analysis, qualitative analysis was performed to analyze the open-ended 
questions in the survey. Interview data were coded using a bottom-up scheme focusing on the three main 
themes: attitudes, usage, and progress from the study (Miles & Huberman, 1994). NVivo was used to 
code the data. Results from qualitative analysis were used to supplement findings from the quantitative 
analysis. 
RESULTS 
Attitudes toward the Site 
Among the four survey items measuring attitudes toward Livemocha, the most positive perceptions were 
that using the site increased users’ motivation and self-confidence (see Table 2). 48% of the participants 
strongly agreed and 37% agreed that, after using Livemocha, they were motivated to spend more time 
learning a language on the site. In addition, 52% strongly agreed and 34% agreed that learning a language 
on Livemocha increased their self-confidence in their target language. A typical comment from the survey 
was, “The best thing on the site is the chatting option. To chat with native speakers gives me confidence”. 
The majority of the case-study participants also took advantage of the site’s online chat rooms to practice 
their English. One noted that this was the first time she had used English in her life outside of school, 
where she had studied English for eight years. The LLSNS experience rendered the English she learned 
“meaningful” and helped her to realize how much she had previously learned in school (case-study 
participant #4).

Language Learning & Technology  132 
Most survey participants also reported feeling more comfortable communicating with native speakers via 
this type of Internet site, as compared to face-to-face communication: with 41% strongly agreeing and 
30% agreeing that they felt more comfortable communicating with native speakers on Livemocha than 
face to face. 
Individuals’ responses that expressed frustration about negative feedback from peers were reverse coded: 
that is, with value 1 representing strong agreement with the statement negative feedback from others on 
the website feels discouraging. While some survey participants felt discouraged by negative feedback, 
overall, their perceptions were above neutral. Nevertheless, the typology of feedback that survey 
participants received and their criteria for considering it discouraging, remain unclear. Answers to one 
open-ended question in the survey, about the best aspect of the LLSNS, revealed a generally positive 
attitude toward receiving feedback and peer review. The survey participants said they appreciated the 
site’s feedback feature as well as those peers who provided feedback to them. A typical comment from 
survey participants was, “Other people can correct my mistakes” (survey participant #23). Another survey 
respondent pointed out: 
The thing I like best about the website is the social part of it. In the first place it’s very nice that 
you are getting feedback from other users (which I experience as very constructive in most cases). 
It’s also really nice that you can help other people who are learning your language (survey 
participant #303).

Usage 
To examine how users took advantage of the site’s features, 528 writing and speaking exercises 
submitted by the twenty case-study participants were analyzed (see Table 3). On average, each case-
study participant submitted 26.4 exercises, including 14 writing and 12.4 speaking exercises. Only one 
participant did not submit any writing exercises, while four did not submit any oral exercises. 
 
Figure 2. Distribution of numbers of exercises submitted over time 
Figure 2 illustrates the numbers of exercises submitted by the case-study participants from their first 
submission to the end of 2011. More than 37% of exercises were submitted within one month of 
registration; and the distribution of the month they were submitted in is skewed to the right, with a 
long tail on the right-hand side indicating the small number of exercises submitted after two months. 
The average time at which the case-study participants submitted their speaking and writing exercises 
was 5.06 months after registration with a standard deviation of 7.27.

Though most exercises were submitted during the first few months of site use, a couple of case-study 
participants persisted in submitting a small number of exercises even after periods of inactivity (see 
Figure 3). One case-study participant did not submit any exercises, and the number of participants who 
did not submit exercises rose from one to eight after the third month. 
 
 
Figure 3. Months in which exercises were submitted by each participant. 
The participants’ first entry time occurred fairly early, approximately 0.33 months after registration. 
Their exit times for exercise submission ranged from 4.0 to 10.9 months, with a mean of 6.19 months 
and a median of 5.42 months. By 10.9 months after registration, all the participants had either 
discontinued use of the site altogether or did not use it regularly (defined as the failure to submit at 
least one exercise per quarter year). As shown in Figure 4, the survival rate dropped to 50% at around 
the five-month mark, and to 25% during the sixth month. 
Survival analysis showed that two factors had a positive effect on the length of exercise submission 
(see Table 4). A 10-year increase in user age resulted in an 11% increase in the period during which 
exercises were submitted. Likewise, a one-unit increase in learning goal was associated with a 7% 
increase in the period of exercise submission. In other words, older people and those with more 
ambitious learning goals persisted longer than younger people and those with lesser learning goals.

Progress 
Individual comments concerning perceived learning progress on Livemocha are set forth in Table 5. 
More than 52% of the participants felt that they learned a lot, and an additional 37% reported making 
some progress. In addition, the participants reported high levels of perceived progress (on a scale of 1–
3) in particular language skills, such as listening (2.74), speaking (2.70), writing (2.67), reading (2.64), 
and vocabulary (2.64).

Participants reported making the least progress in grammar (2.45). Some Livemocha courses offered 
specific grammar instruction sections, and some participants stated that they learned grammar through 
textual examples of complete sentences. One survey respondent reported that he did not have to 
struggle with difficult grammar expositions or exercises that required learners to piece the words 
together (survey respondent #355). One common theme among case-study participants was that, 
though they felt they did not receive enough grammar instruction from the site, they still felt they 
made significant improvements, because, for most of them, this was the first experience of using 
English in meaningful conversation with others. 
Language Accuracy 
We examined the language accuracy and syntactic complexity of 253 English writing exercises 
generated by our case-study participants to evaluate changes in these two areas over time. Among the 
case-study participants, the average word count per submission is 27.8, and words per sentence is 6.41. 
In addition, the average number of errors per T-unit was 2.0, and the error-free T-units were 3.4 (see 
Table 6). The results of HLM analysis (see Table 7) showed that the longer learners stayed on 
Livemocha, the more likely their T-units were to contain errors; however, time spent on the site did 
not affect their number of error-free T-units. Interestingly, learners with a high self-reported level of 
proficiency in the target language made more errors per T-unit than others, and their number of error-
free T-units was not significantly different from those with low self-reported levels of proficiency. 
Proficiency in the target language did not change the growth of language accuracy over time.

Learners with higher learning goals made fewer errors per T-unit than users with less ambitious goals, 
but this effect did not appear in regard to the number of error-free T-units. Learners with higher goals 
decreased their errors per T-unit faster than those with lower goals, but again, error-free T-units 
remained unaffected by users’ goal levels. Participants who spent more time on Livemocha every 
week had more errors per T-unit than those who spent less time on Livemocha and had fewer error-
free T-unit; those who spent more time studying their L2 outside of Livemocha had fewer errors per 
T-unit, but about the same number of error-free T-units as others. In addition, participants’ choice of 
whether to spend the majority of their study time on or off Livemocha did not impact the growth rate 
of their language accuracy.

Syntactic Complexity 
The complexity of sentence structure increased as the participants continued to submit writing exercises 
to the LLSNS (see Table 8). Proficiency in the target language impacted neither syntactic complexity nor 
its growth over time. Ambitious learning goals had a negative impact on both syntactic complexity and its 
growth over time. The division of learning hours between Livemocha and outside venues affected neither 
syntactic complexity nor its growth.

DISCUSSION 
Attitudes 
The improvements we found in perceived self-confidence and motivation may be attributable to the 
participants’ access to and ability to communicate with native speakers of their target language (Kramsch, 
A'Ness, & Lam, 2000). Unlike traditional bottom-up learning that starts with alphabets and phonemes and 
later moves on to words, sentences and grammar, learners on the LLSNS quickly adopted ready-to-use 
sentences and had ample opportunities to practice with native speakers. 
Our findings also showed that the participants felt more comfortable communicating with native speakers 
on the site than face to face. This is consistent with previous research findings that communicating online 
reduces anxiety (Warschauer, 1996a, 1996b; Young, 2003). Learners in online environments may 
experience less stress than traditional learners, because they have more time to review their output before 
sending it to native speakers (Warschauer, 1999). As one user commented, 
It saves embarrassment which you can get if you were in a language class when you make 
mistakes and there is no rushing for tests as you can go in your own pace and slow down with 
your own time. In classes it can get quite competitive so none of that is here (survey participant 
#394). 
Though Stevenson and Liu (2010) reported that some individuals were hesitant to use LLSNSs due to 
their lack of interest in building social relationships, our findings suggested the opposite. Unlike learners 
in the traditional L2 classroom, which is often isolated from both real-world contexts and long-term 
communicative engagement (Thorne, Black, & Sykes, 2009), our participants felt it was natural to engage 
in meaningful conversation with native speakers on the LLSNS. The increased motivation and self-
confidence they reported vis-à-vis the target language suggests that LLSNSs may provide valuable 
opportunities for L2 socialization and engagement. 
Usage and Attrition 
Learning on this LLSNS enables users to connect with native-speaker communities, but whether learners 
can sustain such contact remains a crucial question. Chen (2013) reported an increased number of 
information exchanges involving two case-study participants using Facebook, but our study of Livemocha 
found decreased usage over time. All case-study participants eventually discontinued submitting exercises 
to the site, which may suggest lesson attrition, but the reasons for this remain unknown. For instance, it 
might be due to the completion of lessons, or due to the participants continuing to use the site but with a 
focus on features other than exercise submission. 
The issue of attrition is related to learner autonomy and the provision of access to educational materials. 
Scholars have argued that in CALL environments, autonomous learning—or, learning initiated and 
directed by learners (Littlewood, 1996)—may help learners modify input and output, monitor learning 
progress, develop metacognitive skills, and prioritize their learning (Darawawang & Reinders, 2010). 
However, the development of truly autonomous learners is likely to require more than just having access 
to resources (Nielson, 2011). The mere availability of self-study materials does not guarantee that they 
will be used (Jones, 2001), and learners seem to need additional types of support and guidance (Mozzon-
McPherson, 2007). This is especially the case in out-of-school learning contexts and among adult 
Lin Chin-Hsi, Mark Warschauer, and Robert Blake Language Learning through Social Networks 
 
Language Learning & Technology  142 
learners. As shown by Nielson, participants are often enthusiastic at the beginning of an intervention, and 
yet may not take full advantage of self-access centers and commercial self-study packages. In Nielson’s 
aforementioned study, half of the participants did not even access the software. Without teachers or peers 
to drive the CALL process, it may be difficult to engage users over long periods of time (Jones, 2001). 
Learners require high-quality learning materials, advice, and training (Fernández-Toro, 1999), as well as 
interaction and a sense of community (Blake, 2008; Rovai, 2002), to self-direct their learning simply. 
Interestingly enough, Livemocha provides all the features mentioned above, and yet also suffers a 
considerable amount of lesson attrition. This problem, however, may not be unique to Livemocha or to 
LLSNSs in general. Studies of other types of technology use for autonomous learning – whether 
language-instruction software like Rosetta Stone (Nielson, 2011) or within Massive Open Online Courses 
(MOOCs; Rosé, et al., 2014) – also show high levels of attrition. Although Nielson suggests that 
providing learners with the means to interact with other learners, tutors, or native speakers may help to 
decrease attrition rates, the present study suggests providing communication tools does not automatically 
lead to persistence. 
Though data on attrition rates may seem discouraging, they should not be seen as overriding the potential 
benefits that LLSNSs. Livemocha had 13 million users as of June 2012, which is 4.1 million more 
students than were enrolled in foreign-language classes in all U.S. public schools combined (American 
Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, 2011), while the number of students enrolled in 
languages other than English in U.S. higher education has recently been estimated at 1.7 million (Modern 
Language Association, 2009). Even if the average learning gains per student are small, LLSNSs can have 
a large total impact due to their size. This is somewhat parallel to the situation of MOOCs, which suffer a 
very high attrition rate, yet still have a strong overall educational impact due to the large number of 
enrollees (Koller, 2012). 
Progress 
Perceived progress in listening and speaking points to an important potential benefit of LLSNSs. Previous 
research on online L2 courses has primarily focused on reading and writing with computer-based tools 
(e.g., Chen, 2006; Murphy, 2007); however, our data showed greater perceived progress in listening and 
speaking than in reading and writing. Although this difference was not statistically significant, the 
perception of listening and speaking progress may result from the amount of oral practice, self-
expression, and social interaction that LLSNSs afford to their members. If learners develop the skill of 
communicating with native speakers through SNSs, they can build relationships with them and participate 
in their communities in the target language (see discussion in Harrison & Thomas, 2009; McInnerney & 
Roberts, 2004). LLSNSs appear to create a natural environment in which users can learn and practice 
languages, while further including specific language-learning components. Livemocha users share similar 
goals—learning a language—which adds to their perception that the site is an encouraging environment 
where they can exchange their language expertise. Furthermore, the online presence of numerous ready-
to-chat native speakers makes LLSNSs more interactive than traditional classrooms. One survey 
participant described the Livemocha site as an “open-source language program” (survey participant #248) 
in the sense that all users are able to participate as they want. Many of our respondents also stated that 
they appreciated the site’s integration of community and social learning. As one put it, “I like the way the 
website integrates the idea of community learning, where I could meet people, who are truly native 
speakers and hence, are knowledgeable about the language for which I am learning, and I can exchange 
language ideas” (survey participant #392). 
Regarding actual as distinct from perceived L2 progress, our findings suggest that using Livemocha may 
increase syntactic complexity, with the important caveat that errors per T-unit appear to increase in 
tandem with this. The literature on computer-mediated communication (CMC) has demonstrated 
increasingly complex syntactic structures in online communication (Shang, 2007), but no consensus on 
Lin Chin-Hsi, Mark Warschauer, and Robert Blake Language Learning through Social Networks 
 
Language Learning & Technology  143 
how the use of CMC or SNSs may impact language accuracy. On the one hand, some studies show that 
online students have more opportunities to monitor their language production than traditional students do 
(Warschauer, 1996b, 1999). On the other hand, language use on the Internet is often criticized as being 
less correct and less coherent than other forms of language use, and as having disrupted adjacency 
(Herring, 1999; Kern, 2006). Even with a well-designed curriculum or explicit error correction, some 
studies of online learning have failed to find improvement in language accuracy (Vinagre & Muñoz, 
2011; Young, 2003). It is also possible that students make more errors over time because they are writing 
longer sentences containing more challenging vocabulary, comparable to the well-known u-shaped child 
language learning curve in which infants make more errors in speech as their language develops, before 
accuracy improves again later (Bever, 1982; MacKay, 1982). Further study is needed to investigate more 
fully why measures of student accuracy decrease over time, and why this stands in contrast to students’ 
perceived progress in all aspects of language learning. 
CONCLUSION 
LLSNSs offer the promise of bringing together tutorial software and opportunities to learn from 
interaction with native speakers. The present study helps to confirm the positive potential of LLSNSs for 
language learning, while also revealing possible problems, including lack of long-term persistence and 
failure to contribute to learner accuracy. 
Several limitations of the current study need to be noted. First, as there was no control group, it is not 
possible to attribute any improvement in language skills to the use of Livemocha. Second, due to limits in 
our access to site data, we could not measure the progress of participants in each skill and compare it 
directly with their perceived progress. Lastly, we collected and analyzed the times at which the case-study 
participants submitted speaking exercises, but not the content of each speaking exercise. 
We suggest that future research use more robust measures to examine students’ language development in 
these environments. These could include measures of speaking and listening, which we did not assess, 
and more sophisticated measures of language accuracy that prioritize certain errors (since, for example, a 
misplaced comma may not be as important as an incorrectly conjugated verb). In addition to linguistic 
accuracy, other aspects of L2 play important roles in language learning in a CMC environment, including 
language fluency (Ellis, 2003, 2008), communicative competence (Blake, 2009; Smith, 2003), 
intercultural awareness (Bauer, deBenedette, Furstenberg, Levet, & Waryn, 2006; Belz, 2003), and 
identity development (Black, 2006; Lam, 2006), and these aspects should be assessed as well. Broader 
assessments are required to evaluate whether the perceived benefits of LLSNs match the actual progress 
made by their users across a wide range of language learning outcomes.

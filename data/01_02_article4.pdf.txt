ABSTRACT
This pilot study investigates the potential role of Internet resources as a means to gain a deeper
sense of the culture of the Spanish-speaking world for college students. Thirteen college students
enrolled in the first quarter of Basic Spanish were instructed to utilize the Web to complete five
activities that expanded on the aspects of culture studied in the class. Data collected demonstrate
that the Web is a suitable tool to increase language and cultural knowledge, as well as a means to
increase motivation. Pedagogical implications are discussed.
INTRODUCTION
The last three decades have seen growing attention directed to the issue of teaching culture as part of
foreign language learning. This emphasis on the importance of culture has come hand in hand with
contemporary views of the communicative nature of language. The attainment of communicative
competence requires a diversity of cultural understandings and current theory recognizes the intrinsic role
culture plays in second and foreign language development (Savignon, 1972; Canale & Swain, 1980). The
call for increased learner understanding of the culture as part of language curricula has not, however,
resulted in increased practical implementation of meaningful cultural components in foreign language
instruction. As a result, many foreign language learners demonstrate very limited knowledge about the
culture whose language they study (Sadow, 1987). Several explanations for this situation have been
proffered. Some suggest this is due to foreign language instructors' lack of knowledge. Some attribute the
lack of culture integration in the foreign language curriculum to inappropriate training (Nostrand, 1989).
When culture is included as part of instruction, it is typically prompted by textbooks that are often
deficient in this regard. Mainstream foreign language textbooks tend to bestow one-sided views of the
target culture through piece-meal approaches (Kramsch, 1988; Lafayette 1988).
One antidote has been for teachers to incorporate authentic materials in the foreign language classroom;
these are materials from the target culture that get incorporated in an effort to 1) support language in
context and 2) help learners develop the needed range of communicative/sociolinguistic competencies.
Authentic materials (video, audio, realia) help expose students to the foreign reality as it really is; not as a
make-believe classroom version (Alvarez Evans & González, 1993; García, 1991).
As one form of access to realia, telecommunications represents a teaching tool that potentially connects
learners with authentic culture. By using the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW), students can
have almost instantaneous access to a range of foreign experiences in their target language. The computer
then serves as a gateway to the virtual foreign world where "real people" are using real language in "real
context."
This pilot study set out to assess the potential role of Internet resources as a means for beginning-level
students of Spanish as a foreign language to gain a sense of the cultures of the Spanish-speaking world as
part of their undergraduate language learning experience.

METHODOLOGY
Materials
This study involved the piloting of five Spanish language activities using the Internet. We wished to
assess learners' perceptions of their experiences in terms of both the language and cultural learning
designed into each of the five tasks they were assigned.
The process of creating each of the five activities was as follows:
• A major topic or theme was selected for each chapter covered in the first semester, first-year
Spanish syllabus.
• A task students could carry out under each topic was designed, taking into account the language
knowledge (i.e., grammar and vocabulary) students would need to be successful (Ballman, 1996).
These activities, which integrate Spanish culture and language, were tightly coordinated with the class
textbook  ¿Habla español? (Méndez-Faith, McVey Gill, & Mayne Kienzle, 1993). Since each chapter of
the textbook focuses on a particular Spanish-speaking country, so too does each of the Internet activities.
The types of activity are diverse, with varying foci on language forms, language functions, historical
information, information on the arts, etc. Each activity also varies in terms of purpose: planning a family
trip to Madrid, describing photographs from Argentina, comparing the Universidad Autónoma de México
to the students' own college, finding places for leisure activities in Chile, and creating an authentic
Mexican meal. Each of these activities requires that students access one specified website.
The following is a synopsis of one of the five activities. It uses Softguide Madrid.
Planning a family trip to Madrid
Your family is planning a vacation to Madrid, Spain. Since you speak Spanish, you are in charge of
finding as much information as possible about the city.
(1) Your family will need accommodations. Find names and fees for different kinds of hotels (e.g., luxury,
moderate, hostels, etc.), then decide where you will stay. If you were traveling with friends, where would
you stay?
(2) You will need to eat. However, your father wants authentic Spanish food, your mother is vegetarian,
you enjoy eating light food, and your younger brothers want fast food. Find restaurants to please
everyone in your family.
(3) Your family will like to take some day trips around Madrid. Find a place to visit, find the train number
you will need to take, and decide if this is a good place for your younger brothers.
(4) Your family wants to visit the Prado Museum. Find the location and hours of operation. You probably
want to visit when there is free admission. When is it?
Finding appropriate Internet sites was accomplished by making extensive searches by country, key words,
and by reviewing foreign language instruction resource pages. After selecting several suitable sites for a
specific country, the search was narrowed to those sites that fit the above criteria.
Context
Students undertook these five tasks independently as homework. They had access to the sites through
campus facilities: dormitory terminals and other campus user rooms. Each activity was worth 50 points.
Points were given for completed assignments, not for right/wrong answers. If and when learners
encountered difficulty, they contacted the instructor via e-mail for assistance and clarification. Once
students had completed the activities, the processes and outcomes of their work were discussed in class.

Language Learning & Technology 73
The cultural knowledge they had developed through the activity was also expanded upon through
discussion.
Subjects
Subjects were thirteen undergraduate students enrolled in their first college trimester of Elementary
Spanish. Except for one, all were computer literate with prior Internet experience. After completing each
of the five language and culture activities, the students completed a post-activity questionnaire. They were
able to agree or disagree with different statements intended to measure their perceptions of learning
outcomes and the effectiveness of the task and the technology they used to accomplish it. Students
completed an additional survey at the end of the term that queried their reactions to the activities as a
whole.
Method of Assessment
A post-activity assessment questionnaire accompanied each activity. The questionnaire has two sections.
The first section measured perceived learning outcomes (language, culture, integration of culture and
language), reaction to the medium (site accessibility, ease of use, usefulness of information, and
additional visits to site), and assessment of the task (ease of completion and length of time to complete
task) in a 6 point Likert-type format. Attitudes towards the technology and the activity itself were
measured by similar items on the questionnaire along with open-ended questions. A space for suggested
improvements was also provided.
On the completion of all five activities, subjects completed an additional survey to provide a
comprehensive view of integrating language and culture through use of the Internet.
RESULTS
Data reflecting subjects' perceived learning outcomes is presented in Figure 1. The number under each
activity represents the percentage of subjects who agreed with the statement. The last column shows the
mean of subjects in agreement for all activities. Eighty-eight percent of the subjects reported increased
knowledge of Spanish language and culture. This finding is remarkable because all activities exhibited a
high percentage of subjects identifying increased knowledge of language integrated with culture (i.e.,
from 85% to 100%) . In order to identify if either factor had a greater effect on learning, culture and
language outcomes were measured separately. Results for culture learning separated from language
learning were also very positive. Eighty-one percent of the subjects reported that cultural learning was
occurring. When subjects were asked about learning language separated from culture, 77% reported gains.
Figure 1. Perceived Learning Outcomes
  
When asked about their attitude concerning the medium, 85% of the subjects indicated enjoyment using
the Internet ( Figure 2 ). In spite of some minor technical difficulties they encountered when completing
the five tasks, 69% of subjects indicated that Web sites were always accessible, 71% reported that sites
Maritza M. Osuna & Carla Meskill Using the World Wide Web to Integrate Spanish Language…
Language Learning & Technology 74
were easy to use, and 71% agreed on the usefulness of information to everyday life. Thirty-two percent of
subjects returned to the site after completing the task.
Figure 2. Technology Outcomes
*Results for accessibility and ease using the site for the second activity need to be interpreted in the light
of the fact that the original site was not in service at the time required. A Web search produced another
site, which resembled the original one very closely. However, instructions for the activity did not exactly
match the new site and some subjects had some difficulties adjusting.
Figure 3 summarizes responses to the tasks subjects were assigned to undertake. Sixty-eight percent of
subjects indicated that instructions were easy to follow. Time on task was reported as one hour or less by
74%.
Figure 3. Responses to task technicalities
Figure 4 presents data collected after subjects completed all five activities. One hundred percent of
responses indicated that subjects enjoyed using the Internet in the course because it made for a more
interesting class. When asked if they felt they had learned more Spanish by doing the Web activities, the
entire group (100%) agreed with the statement. All subjects (100%) also recognized the Web as a
valuable learning tool offering updated information in comparison to printed resources. Subjects'
satisfaction with the medium was also assessed through other statements about the Internet. Because
many subjects stated that the Web was a necessary component of instruction (83%) , it was easy to use
(92%), and they felt comfortable using it (92%), a high number of the subjects (92%) reported that they
would take another course that required use of the Internet. Interestingly, there was no direct correlation
between getting a better grade because of the Web (67%) and learning Spanish (92%). Although the
majority of the subjects (12 out of 13) had had previous Internet exposure, one half agreed that using the
Web for this class had resulted in the acquisition of additional technical skills.

DISCUSSION
Integration of Culture and Language
The results of this small pilot demonstrate that the Internet is an excellent tool for teaching foreign
language and culture. We tentatively see these positive results as related to a balanced interaction of the
following:
• Course textbook
• Language and culture
• Carefully orchestrated, purposeful use of the target language
• Variety and relevance of task types
• Authenticity of the Spanish-speaking cultures provided by the Internet
Maritza M. Osuna & Carla Meskill Using the World Wide Web to Integrate Spanish Language…
Language Learning & Technology 77
The integration of each of the textbook chapter's cultural component with the language foci of that
chapter worked well in bringing contextualized meaning and practice to the online tasks. The tasks
successfully served as a means of broadening the students' learning experience and connection to target
cultures. Furthermore, by virtue of these connections, students mindfully engaged in the activities because
they saw them as an integral part of the class, not as an add-on.
 Anecdotal comments shown in Table 1 reflect student satisfaction with learning about the culture of other
peoples. In these tasks, as in real life, language and culture remained together, without one overpowering
the other, to foster authentic communication. Finally an emphasis on realistic language use, not language
rules, allowed for communicative practice in authentic settings.
Interestingly, the most favored activity was the creation of an authentic Mexican meal, which 92% of the
subjects enjoyed. This activity allowed the students to explore different Mexican regions in search of an
appropriate dish for their menu. Once the decision was made, the "chef" was presented with a
scrumptious dish. As a consequence, all the rich and authentic display of food made many people hungry!
The slightly lower number of subjects reporting cultural gains distinct from language learned was
somewhat anticipated. In authentic settings, culture and language are complementary components of
communication. One without the other will always be deficient, as the separation of language and culture
demonstrate. Another reason explaining lower results for language lies in classroom culture. Students
generally associate language learning with explicit morphosyntactic teaching. Thus, when subjects were
asked directly if language learning was taking place, some did not recognize it. This finding, however, is
not surprising because as research has demonstrated, implicit language teaching and learning is difficult
to assess (DeKeyser, 1995, Green and Hecht, 1992; Scott, 1990; Shaffer, 1989;). Even though separation
of language and culture still produced satisfactory results, the best outcome was obtained when language
and culture were integrated. This finding strengthens the importance of teaching language and culture in
context, a point that cannot be overemphasized. Data from this small pilot demonstrate that if students
studying foreign language are to become successful learners, integration of language and culture is
pivotal.
Technology
The high mark for satisfaction with the medium (mean of 85%) obtained on each of the five task-related
surveys increased to 100% in the final retrospective questionnaire (Figure 4) . This is an exciting result,
especially for foreign language teachers in search of instructional activities that will increase time on task.
As Figure 4 shows, there is a direct relation between satisfaction and level of interest. If, as subjects
reported, using the Web makes the class more interesting, they will be willing to spend more time
performing a task or browsing over other information connected to it. As one subject admits "... the site
was fantastic and again I felt compelled to explore on my own ...."
Satisfaction with the medium clearly outweighed any dissatisfaction due to technical difficulties
encountered in accessing and using the sites. Figure 4 shows that all subjects saw the Web as a valuable
learning tool that offered current information. This fact is also supported by the anecdotal statements in
Table 1 in which five subjects commented positively about Web information being current, interesting,
varied, and useful in real life.
Another explanation may be found in the medium's intrinsic characteristics. As mentioned before, the
Web offers current, interesting, varied, and useful information that engages multiple modalities through
combined text, sound, and visuals. One of these, to which subjects categorically referred and which they
enjoyed, was the visual element. Engagement with visuals, as seen in the seventeen references in Table 1,
brought about positive attitudes about cultural learning. The following comment illustrates this point:
"From the photographs I viewed on the Web, I think parts of Argentina must be absolutely beautiful. I
think it is rich in culture and tradition, and, if I had the chance to go to Argentina to dance a tango, I'd go
Maritza M. Osuna & Carla Meskill Using the World Wide Web to Integrate Spanish Language…
Language Learning & Technology 78
in a flash." According to Monroe (1993), education has overlooked the relevance of visual stimuli in
favor of verbal and analytical skills. Hence the incorporation of graphics in instructional materials is the
result of instinct, not of principles (Rakes, 1996). Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that visuals can
be employed to aid learning and foster positive attitudes (Poohkay & Szabo, 1995), and visual stimuli can
also become memory-assisting devices (Stickels & Schwartz, 1987) as well as comprehension scaffolds
(Meskill, 1996). Data presented here strongly suggest that inclusion of visual text for foreign language
instruction is highly desirable. However, this integration needs to be thoughtfully planned to produce
positive outcomes, such as accelerating learning, increasing learning efficiency, and facilitating retention
(Rakes, 1996). Three of the activities presented in this paper (describing photographs from Argentina,
finding places for leisure activities in Chile, and creating an authentic Mexican meal) provided a rich
display of visual stimuli in the form of photographs. Monroe (1993) claims that photography is an entry
device into a culture and its relationships. Through photography subjects came across colorful and
authentic manifestations of foreign people, places, costumes and relationships. In both activities, subjects
were free to choose what to observe and what to describe. Opportunity to select what to see was
advantageous because it offered flexibility to find what was relevant to each individual's own experience.
Thus, each observer constructed unique meanings and interpretations of the visual text. Referring
specifically to these activities, subjects commented on the opportunity to be creative as they engaged in
mentally stimulating activities (Table 1) .
Moving into another aspect of motivation, it is encouraging to report that once having completed an
assigned task, one third of the subjects returned to the sites on their own. Suffice it to say that even
though motivation for learning beyond expectations is not a very common or easily measured outcome in
an instructional setting, this modest outcome would appear to support integrating the Web in foreign
language instruction.
Activities
If subjects were ready to overlook deficiencies in the technology without this negatively influencing their
attitude towards the medium, they were less willing to ignore tasks' "unclear instructions." Subjects
indicated they would have liked more detailed instructions to complete the tasks (Table 1). Additionally,
many of the students' suggestions for improvement overall had to do with improving the task directions.
Despite the fact that instructions for the first activity were in English, students had difficulty following
them. It may well be that, because this was the first activity, many subjects were unfamiliar with
retrieving specific information demanded by the task , or did not read directions carefully, as some of
them reported orally throughout the term. Nevertheless, it may be that it was not the clarity of the
instructions that produced uneasiness in the students, but rather the task requirements. All activities had
open-ended questions with no clear right or wrong answers. This type of question perhaps produces too
much anxiety in college students in general and beginner foreign language learners in particular.
This may be a reason for them to label the instructions as ambiguous or difficult to understand.
Nevertheless, as familiarity with the technology developed, they were less apprehensive about exploring
on their own, regardless of any lack of clarity in the instructions.
CONCLUSION
This pilot study integrated Spanish language and culture using the Internet. Results affirm that the
medium is a valuable tool for foreign language and cultural learning. Technology seems to be especially
beneficial in promoting cultural learning. According to the pilot's participants, advantages of the Internet
over other media and instructional tools are numerous: It is informative, "a great way of learning a lot
about a foreign place"; it is interesting, ". . .at times I felt so compelled to stray away from the assignment
and get side-tracked with the other interesting information"; it is actual, ". . .more current than just
reading about it in a book"; it is a good learning tool, "it sincerely helped me use and learn Spanish

Language Learning & Technology 79
language and vocabulary"; it is enjoyable, ". . .it was actually pretty fun"; it is authentic and real, ". . .this
country seems much like the U.S. but it has a very different culture"; and it is a multimodal medium
because it can offer text, sound, and visuals, ". . .many of the pictures were beautiful. . .great. .
.interesting." Data presented here also show very high satisfaction when using the Web for foreign
language learning, to the point of outweighing technical challenges.
We find these results most encouraging. They should signal to foreign and second language professionals
that the easily accessible and varied resources of the World Wide Web have enormous potential for
supporting the integration of culture in the foreign language curriculum.

How to create a web activity for foreign languages
1) Select a topic from your textbook.
2) Think about what language functions can be derived from this topic. In other words, what are
some of the communicative acts native speakers engage in when dealing with the topic?
3) Think about the cultural component encompassing the communicative process.
4) Choose tasks that integrate language and cultural in a natural way.
5) Search the Internet for a web site to match your tasks:
• Do a search by country and key word(s) associated with the topic selected.
• Browse around different sites to find a good match for the tasks. If you are not satisfied, keep
searching  or adapt your tasks to the information provided at the site.
• WARNING: Web sites can disappear without notice. Choose a site that is connected to a
government agency, a university, a large corporation. This type of sites tends to be more reliable.
6) When you write the activity, give clear and specific instructions.
7) Write the activity in the target language.
• If the activity is for novice learners, use the language in a very controlled fashion. That is, use the
language learners know, yet go a bit beyond their proficiency level. If the language employed is
to challenging, they will be inclined to give up on the task.
8) When writing the activity, take advantage of the multimedia dimensions of the medium. Use
picture, graphics, movies, music, etc. Think about what can be accomplished by using a computer
as opposed to using a textbook. If possible, write the activity to integrate all language skills:
• Reading. Have students read short selections. Check reading comprehension using true/false
statements.
• Writing. Have students write a about what they read, complete open-ended questions, react to
visuals, etc.
• Speaking. After the activity is completed students can discuss, compare, and contrast tasks.
• Listening. There are wonderful musical recordings on the web. Lyrics in the target language can
function as a mirror of the target culture. Use them to elicit discussion.
9) Consider the length of the activity. One hour is a good amount of time on task.
10) If your activity is curriculum based and integrates language with culture, your students will
experience linguistic growth, enriched cultural knowledge, and increased motivation. Sounds too
good to be true? Try it!

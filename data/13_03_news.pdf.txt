LANGUAGE LEARNING IN COMPUTER MEDIATED COMMUNITIES (LLCMC) 
CONFERENCE (OCTOBER 11-13, 2009) 
Once, computers were seen as thinking machines or electronic tutors. Now the computer has become one 
of many devices that people use to form virtual communities of all kinds. In the field of language 
education, computer mediated communication (CMC) enables students to interact with one another free 
of space and time constraints and to participate in communities of learning with their counterparts in the 
target culture. The Language Learning in Computer Mediated Communities (LLCMC) Conference 
explores the use of computers as a medium of communication in language learning communities. 
Conference highlights will include a plenary talk by Dr. Gilberte Furstenburg (MIT), a special panel 
presentation showcasing online cultural exchanges based at the University of Hawai‘i, and a variety of 
intriguing concurrent sessions.

Call for Papers for Special Issue of LLT 
 
Theme: Technology and Learning Grammar 
 
Guest Editor: Trude Heift 
Advances in computer technology offer a range of new opportunities for language learners to gain 
awareness of grammatical structures and to develop L2 grammar proficiency. Since the inception of the 
internet, the amount of grammar exercises has been increasing steadily, in part due to useful authoring 
tools that have been developed over the past years. Related fields, such as corpus and computational 
linguistics, have exploited technology to provide tools that may contribute to a richer, more 
comprehensive and individualized grammar learning experience. For instance, technology-based grammar 
instruction now provides proofing tools, corpora, and concordancers specifically geared toward the 
language learner. Static as well as dynamic help aids such as inflectional paradigms, grammar notes and 
dictionaries have also been incorporated into grammar teaching. Progress has also been noted in the 
domains of SLA theory and language pedagogy, in particular, with respect to learner control, corrective 
feedback and error correction. This special issue of Language Learning & Technology aims at providing a 
variety of perspectives in this area through research articles and theoretical discussions of technology-
supported grammar instruction, language acquisition, and testing. 
 
Possible submissions include but are not limited to: 
 
• a comprehensive literature review of technology-based grammar instruction 
• a discussion of theoretical frameworks for aspects of technology-based grammar instruction 
• theoretical models of error diagnosis and error correction (e.g., NLP-based or nonparser-based 
approaches, student modeling techniques) 
• research on the link between computer-based activities that promote grammar skills and those that 
promote language acquisition 
• overviews of research on the role of technology in developing grammar proficiency  
• studies of the efficacy and/or utilization of corpora, concordancers, proofing tools and other grammar 
aids to support grammar acquisition and proficiency 
• studies of corrective feedback, learner control and error correction with respect to technology-based 
grammar instruction 
• comparisons of technology use (i.e., proofing tools) by native versus foreign language learners 
• studies of computer-based instruments for assessing various aspects of grammar proficiency 
• computer-based testing of grammar proficiency 
 
Please send an email of intent with a 250-word abstract by May 1, 2007, to llt-editors@hawaii.edu.

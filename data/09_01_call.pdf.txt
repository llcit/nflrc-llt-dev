Theme: Technology and Listening Comprehension  
Guest Editor: Philip Hubbard 
Developments in multimedia software and the Web offer a range of new opportunities for learners to 
develop listening proficiency in the target language. Multimedia programs combine digital audio, 
graphics, and video with an array of meaning aids and afford a high level of individual control, while the 
Web makes it possible for easy access to an assortment of listening experiences, including exposure to an 
unprecedented selection of unfiltered native speaker materials. This special issue of Language Learning 
& Technology aims at providing a variety of perspectives in this area through research articles and 
theoretical discussions in the domains of technology-based comprehension, language acquisition, and 
testing. 
Possible topics include, but are not limited to  
• a comprehensive literature review of technology and listening comprehension  
• theories or theoretical frameworks for aspects of computer-based listening 
• research on the link between computer-based activities that promote listening comprehension and 
those that promote language acquisition 
• studies on the utilization of authentic listening materials on the Web 
• studies of the efficacy of technology-based meaning aids (captions, glosses, graphics, 
translations, etc.) to support comprehension and acquisition 
• studies of the use of technology for the co-development of listening and reading proficiency  
• studies of the impact of listening and handheld technologies (mobile phones, MP3 players, etc.) 
on comprehension 
• research into the use of DVDs for language learning 
• computer-based testing of listening proficiency

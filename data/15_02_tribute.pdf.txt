TRIBUTE TO IRENE THOMPSON 
In July 1997, Mark Warschauer realized his vision of an open access journal for 
emerging research in the field of computer-assisted language learning as the founding 
Editor of Language Learning & Technology. A year later, in July 1998, Lucinda Hart-
González joined as a Co-Editor (serving for two years in that position), and in January 
1999, Irene Thompson came on board as the third Editor. Thirteen years and 37 issues 
later, Irene is stepping down at the end of August 2011. I have had the great privilege 
and pleasure to work with Irene for the last 12 years since 2000 and would like to offer a 
tribute to her for helping to bring LLT to the tremendous heights it has reached. 
In 1998, LLT had more than 1,000 readers worldwide. In 2010, there were 18,214 
official subscribers, and the journal’s Website has an average of 1,513 visitors per day, 
with over 552,000 visitors during the year. Since 2003, LLT has been indexed in the 
exclusive Institute for Scientific Information’s (ISI) Social Sciences Citation Index 
(SSCI), ISI Alerting Services, Social SciSearch, and Current Contents/Social and 
Behavioral Sciences, and in 2009 was ranked 3rd in Linguistics journals (out of 93) and 
3rd in Education journals (out of 139).

A study by Smith and Lafford (2009) that appeared in The Modern Language Journal 
surveyed expert researchers in language education and technology. These experts ranked 
Language Learning & Technology highest in quality in a list of 19 academic journals. 
LLT was also ranked first in terms of these scholars’ preferences for publishing their 
own research and in having benefit for tenure/promotion. 
All of the above successes are due in large measure to Irene Thompson’s expertise, 
dedication, thoroughness, attention to detail and unwavering commitment to excellence. 
She has worked tirelessly on all aspects of the journal, from the layout and design of the 
Website to the copyediting of individual articles and reviews, from performing internal 
reviews of the 150+ yearly submissions during the last several years to working closely 
with authors to craft publishable articles. During the time of her editorship, the journal 
has received over 1,300 submissions! Although we are on opposite ends of the continent, 
working with Irene these past 12 years has been seamless, enjoyable, and immensely 
rewarding. My heartfelt gratitude to her professionally and personally, and my very best 
wishes for her well deserved retirement. 
Despite the sadness of Irene Thompson’s departure, the journal seems to have come full 
circle as we welcome Mark Warschauer back as Co-Editor. LLT will no doubt continue 
to thrive and benefit from Mark’s visionary leadership. Aloha and mahalo to Irene and 
welcome back, Mark! 
Sincerely, 
Dorothy Chun  
Editor-in-Chief

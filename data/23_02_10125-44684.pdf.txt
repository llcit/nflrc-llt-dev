Abstract 
Captions provide a useful aid to language learners for comprehending videos and learning new vocabulary, 
aligning with theories of multimedia learning. Multimedia learning predicts that a learner’s working 
memory (WM) influences the usefulness of captions. In this study, we present two eye-tracking experiments 
investigating the role of WM in captioned video viewing behavior and comprehension. In Experiment 1, 
Spanish-as-a-foreign-language learners differed in caption use according to their level of comprehension 
and to a lesser extent, their WM capacities. WM did not impact comprehension. In Experiment 2, English-
as-a-second-language learners differed in comprehension according to their WM capacities. Those with 
high comprehension and high WM used captions less on a second viewing. These findings highlight the 
effects of potential individual differences and have implications for the integration of multimedia with 
captions in instructed language learning. We discuss how captions may help neutralize some of working 
memory’s limiting effects on learning.

Introduction 
An important part of the process of learning a second language (L2) is paying attention to and making sense 
of the stimuli available from written text or speech. In listening, segmenting speech can be a daunting task 
for L2 learners. If that basic task is unsuccessful, learning from listening is unlikely. Captions1 help learners 
process aural language by putting printed words on a screen as the words are heard, creating a visual means 
for determining linguistic units (e.g., words, morphemes, grammatical components). This helps students 
map the aural speech stream to individual (meaningful) words and phrases. 
In our previous work (Winke, Gass, & Sydorenko, 2010, 2013), we investigated whether L2 learners made 
use of captions as a tool for listening comprehension in a classroom context. We examined how caption use 
was mediated by the learners’ familiarity with the video content and with the teacher’s ordering of video 
showings (with and without captions). We also investigated the impact of L1–L2 orthography differences. 
In post-task interviews, we found that captions helped learners with listening comprehension, and that they 
aided learners in segmenting speech streams into meaningful components. In this article, we extend our 
earlier work and look more into the how. Our main concern is with how individual differences impact 
caption use, with a focus on learners’ working memory (WM) capacities. We do this through an 
investigation of two populations of learners, English as a second language (ESL) learners and foreign 
language learners (English speakers learning Spanish) to see what trends emerge across the language-

learning contexts. 
Captions Within Multimedia Learning and Working Memory Theories 
Our investigation is grounded in multimedia learning, a cognitive theory that claims learning is deeper and 
longer lasting when there is both aural and visual information to support it (Mayer, 2014). Multimedia 
learning theory is based on the multimedia principle: “people can learn more deeply from words and 
pictures than from words alone” (Mayer, 2014, p. 1). 
In his 2014 work, Mayer outlined underlying assumptions. First, multimedia learning occurs when there 
are multiple input channels (generally, visual and aural). And second, individuals have a limited capacity 
for information processing in a single mode. Thus, learners must be selective and attend to only certain 
input in a particular modality. Not being selective can result in a cognitive-processing overload (Paas & 
Sweller, 2014; Sweller, 2005). Components of WM (Baddeley, 2000) serve key functions. Information first 
enters temporary memory stores, including the phonological loop (responsible for encoding the sounds we 
hear) and visuospatial sketchpad (responsible for encoding visual information and spatial relations). The 
central executive controls the flow of information between the loop and sketchpad, and can call on other 
memory stores (e.g., long-term memory) for higher-level cognitive functions (e.g., to compare or contrast). 
These information pieces come together within the episodic buffer, and eventually, the information is more 
permanently stored in long-term memory for later retrieval. Thus, within the episodic buffer, a mental 
representation is constructed. Learning involves sifting through, organizing, and integrating information 
(sometimes across channels) to create new information (in particular, see Desjarlais, 2017, p. 125). As 
Wiley, Sanchez, and Jaeger (2014) wrote, “[e]ffective use of the working memory system is critical for 
successful learning” (p. 598). Similarly drawing on WM, language learners map linguistic form to meaning, 
aided by the central executive’s functioning and directing of input. WM shows considerable associations 
with L2 comprehension and learning (Linck, Osthus, Koeth, & Bunting, 2014), and its relevance to both 
multimedia learning and second language acquisition (SLA) motivate our present focus.  
The general notion is that captions, within a multimedia learning context, may counter limitations in WM 
that hamper the processing of spoken language. From the language learning side, comprehending L2 videos 
is a difficult task, requiring extra attention to linguistic form when compared to L1 comprehension, and 
thus, L2 comprehension taxes WM and other cognitive resources. In line with multimedia learning 
principles, captions visually signal relevant linguistic information (e.g., word boundaries, forms) to aid 
comprehension of speech in the aural channel. Of course, captions do not exist in visual isolation, and must 
be considered alongside moving images in a multimedia learning environment. At first glance, captions 
may appear to compete with video in the visual channel, risking cognitive overload for learners who split 
their attention too thinly (Ayres & Sweller, 2014). However, if a learner’s attention is usefully drawn to 
captions to facilitate the processing of linguistic information, the learner is likely to temporarily ignore the 
video imagery. And because captions are physically and temporally overlaid on a video, switching between 
and integrating visual media can be facilitated. Per Ayres and Sweller (2014), when the cognitive load of 
video comprehension is manageable, such as when content is not completely novel or when a video’s 
difficulty level is appropriate for language learners, integrating multiple input modes will likely be 
manageable and beneficial. But when the content itself is more difficult and includes too much novel input, 
the processing load increases, making the intake and use of the multiple modalities more difficult. If the 
content is familiar and not difficult, the learner may not need captions to facilitate processing; in such cases, 
captions could be seen as superfluous or even annoying. 
Second and Foreign Language Multimedia Learning: The Role of Captions 
Multimedia learning has been approached from a variety of perspectives, including research on web use 
(Chun, 2001), annotations for vocabulary use (Chun & Plass, 1996), picture annotation (Chun & Plass, 
1998), and captioning in extended foreign-language television watching (Rodgers & Webb, 2017). This 
86 Language Learning & Technology 
 
research has been important in applied linguists’ understanding of multimedia learning and has set the stage 
for research on captions for L2 learners. 
A meta-analysis by Montero Perez, Van den Noortgate, and Desmet (2013) included 18 experimental 
studies that examined the effects of captions on listening comprehension and vocabulary learning. They 
found captions statistically and significantly influenced listening comprehension and vocabulary learning. 
Indeed, in our study (Winke et al., 2013) on the effects of captions on listening comprehension and 
vocabulary learning, we supported these general findings, showing that captions had a large effect on 
vocabulary learning and comprehension as compared to no captions.  
With the general utility of captions for L2 learning well-established (Rodgers & Webb, 2017; Vanderplank, 
2016a, 2016b), we turn to other factors that may play a role in the instantiation of multimedia learning. 
Vanderplank (2016b) alluded to the vast precipice upon which L2 acquisition and captioning researchers 
now stand. He noted that researchers are yet to recognize (yet alone study) how learners use the language 
made available in captioned videos and how they use the multimedia material (with captions) to build their 
language abilities. He noted that learners apply different strategies when viewing captioned material. 
Vanderplank claimed that most of what applied linguists know about captions “is still largely anecdotal” 
(p. 246). These situations, factors, and contexts in relation to captions need investigation. 
In a previous study (Winke et al., 2010), we considered caption use in repeated viewings, and investigated 
how L2 (Arabic, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish) and proficiency level influenced learning. For captions in 
repeated viewings, we found that watching a video with captions two times was most effective, a somewhat 
predictable outcome. More interestingly, when only having captions available for one of two viewings, 
there was a difference for script-similar L1–L2 combinations and script-dissimilar combinations: L1 
English learners of Spanish and Russian performed better when captions were available in the first viewing, 
whereas learners of Arabic and Chinese performed better when captions were available second. In both 
cases, learners noticed new information (Schmidt, 2001) in the first viewing and used the second viewing 
to confirm what they had noticed. For learners without orthographic dissimilarity, during the first viewing, 
they were able to take advantage of the written word as initial intake; but for those where the L1 and L2 
had significant orthographic distance, the aural information served as the initial intake. This latter group 
was not able to easily utilize the written script and relied on aural input to recognize new information. 
Continuing to explore factors that affect caption use, we investigated how L1–L2 differences and content 
familiarity affected caption viewing (Winke et al., 2013). Using eye-tracking technology with learners of 
Arabic, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish, we found that Arabic learners spent more time reading captions 
than Russian and Spanish learners. The Chinese learners, while not distinct from the other groups on 
average, showed greater within-group variation in caption use. For content familiarity, only Chinese 
learners watching an unfamiliar video had significantly higher caption reading time, though other L2 groups 
showed a trend in that direction. This was consistent with the suggestion by Ayres and Sweller (2014) that 
multimedia learning may be more difficult for novel content. Ultimately, we concluded that major L1–L2 
script differences are likely to affect how captions are used by L2 learners, at least at earlier stages of 
proficiency. Additionally, we found that when understanding the video was particularly difficult (i.e., due 
to unfamiliar content or lexis), learners directed their resources to fewer input modalities (e.g., largely 
ignoring imagery and using captions more or vice versa). 
Other researchers have addressed the role of proficiency in how learners use and benefit from captions. By 
introducing mismatching information in captions and audio, Leveridge and Yang (2013) determined that 
more proficient English learners relied less on captions to process information, a finding also stated by 
Pujola (2002). A greater reliance on captions seems to require attentional trade-offs, as lower proficiency 
learners in Taylor (2005) reported difficulty in simultaneously processing audio, visuals, and captions. In 
terms of benefits, findings have been mixed. Lwo and Lin (2012) found lower-proficiency learners 
benefited more than higher-proficiency learners in terms of comprehension when provided with L2 English 
captions. However, other researchers reported larger benefits for intermediate and advanced L2 users when 
compared to beginners (Montero Perez et al., 2013; Neuman & Koskinen, 1992; Taylor, 2005; 
Susan Gass, Paula Winke, Daniel R. Isbell, and Jieun Ahn 87 
 
Vanderplank, 1988). 
Speed of caption presentation also impacts viewing behavior. Kruger (2013) found that as the speed of 
captions (manipulated by adjusting the total time each caption is visible) increased, learners shifted their 
focus to more static information, which in this case included presentation slides and pictures of a lecturer’s 
face. Similarly, Mayer, Lee, and Peebles (2014) observed that while adding video to a slower-paced audio 
narration enhanced comprehension, adding captions to faster narration with video had no beneficial effect 
on understanding. In high-burden multimedia situations, learners cope by tuning out one or more modalities. 
Captions have often been criticized as crutches when they are present but not needed (Mitterer & McQueen, 
2009). For instance, Markham, Peter, and McCarthy (2001) wrote that “captions may provide too tempting 
a crutch for those students who are developmentally ready to test their listening skills in a captionless 
environment” (p. 341). Likewise, learners in the study by Danan (2016) suggested captions “might become 
a distraction or a crutch” if they “focused too much on the words on the screen instead of listening” (p. 14). 
Thus, there is a sense that at a certain point, captions may be redundant, detrimental to the process of 
learning to segment or parse speech, or not needed for comprehension. Researchers have noted that some 
learners may focus on the aural input and close their eyes to eliminate the visuals, thus reducing the written 
input stream (see also Winke et al., 2010), or ignore the captions to reduce the amount of incoming 
information (Taylor, 2005). Thus, there may be a zone within which captions are most useful, perhaps 
centered where the content difficulty level is not too far above or below a learner’s ability level. But this 
zone may be larger or smaller, contingent on learning goals, individual goals, and linguistic factors relative 
to the text, the learner, or both. Indeed, Vanderplank (2016a) outlined how captioned video for language 
learners can help the learners not only segment speech and learn about culture, but also develop their 
literacy, especially when video watching is sustained over a long period of time (through watching series, 
or entire sets of film over a period of time as part of a learning strategy or as part of a language-learning 
curriculum). However, he noted that “the relative effectiveness of captioned viewing varies according to 
language level” (p. 4). We suspect that this is true with the added caveat that the viewer’s language level 
must be not too far from the difficulty level of the captioned material for captioning to be effective and 
helpful. Other researchers have picked up on these notions. For example, Mirzaei, Meshgi, Akita, and 
Kawahara (2017), in a study of Japanese university students studying English in Japan, used partial 
captioning (akin to key-word captioning; see Montero Perez, Peters, & Desmet, 2014). However, in their 
study, the key-word captions were produced based on corpus linguistics and word frequency lists. They 
synchronized the captions with the video’s speech through automatic speech recognition software to 
investigate whether English captions with only difficult or less-frequent words would be more beneficial 
for comprehension. They found that captions were more beneficial, no matter if they were full captions or 
partial and synchronized captions, but that partial and synchronized captions might be preferred, 
theoretically and pedagogically, because they encouraged more listening. Such research is important for 
understanding how captions work within the cognitive load theory, but more work is also needed to 
understand how learners’ individual differences affect the process of using captions—any type of 
captions—beneficially. 
A fuller understanding of the factors affecting L2 and foreign language caption use and resultant learning 
could be profitably used in both the design of instructional materials and the understanding of language 
learning more generally. We now turn to the present study which utilizes eye-tracking and WM measures 
to understand how full captions are used by L2 Spanish learners and L2 English learners. 
The Current Study 
In this article, our primary focus is on how language learners make use of captions and how WM influences 
learners’ global caption reading behavior and video comprehension. To broaden the scope of previous 
research, we conducted two parallel experiments with participants sampled from two distinct populations: 
Spanish foreign-language learners (Experiment 1) and English second-language learners (Experiment 2). 
We did this in order to sample learners from two different learning environments, one with limited exposure 
88 Language Learning & Technology 
 
to the target language and the other with greater exposure. The following research questions (RQs) guided 
both experiments: 
1. Does captioning aid comprehension? 
Prediction: Captioned videos will result in better comprehension of video content (Experiment 1 
only). 
2. What is the relationship between WM and L2 video comprehension? Do learners with high WM 
capacity comprehend more than learners with low WM capacity? 
Prediction: Those with higher WM will have higher comprehension scores, given that WM aids 
the integration of information for overall comprehension. 
3. What is the relationship between WM and caption-reading behavior? Are there differences in 
caption-reading behavior between learners with high WM and learners with low WM? 
Prediction: Learners with greater WM capacity will exhibit somewhat less reliance on captions, as 
they are better able to cope with multimedia input. 
4. What is the relationship between caption-reading behavior and L2 video comprehension? Are there 
differences in caption-reading behaviors between learners who demonstrate high video-
comprehension and learners who demonstrate low video-comprehension? 
Prediction: Based on our prior work (Winke et al., 2010, 2013), learners with low comprehension 
will likely use captions less than those with high comprehension. 
General Method 
For both experiments, we utilized eye-tracking for data collection. The assumption underlying eye-tracking 
is a strong association between eye movement and the human mind, referred to as the eye-mind link 
(Reichle, Pollatsek, & Rayner, 2012). In other words, one’s eye focuses on what one is thinking about, 
thereby giving researchers insight into the mind. 
A handful of researchers have utilized this technology to study caption-reading behavior. In several eye-
tracking studies, d’Ydewalle and colleagues (d’Ydewalle & De Bruycker, 2007; d’Ydewalle & Gielen, 
1992; d’Ydewalle, Praet, Verfaillie, & Van Rensbergen, 1991) and Bisson, Van Heuven, Conklin, and 
Tunney (2014) found an attentional bias toward subtitling or captions during video watching. As explained 
by Ghia (2012), “subtitled audio visual texts are semiotically and communicatively complex works, and are 
characterized by a constant interplay among their aural and visual components. … The exploration of the 
acquisitional potential of all such components is of paramount importance” (p. 2). While eye-tracking 
technology can be used to examine the effect of specific conditions or linguistic features and trial-level 
reading behaviors (e.g., individual captions, d’Ydewalle & De Bruycker, 2007; individual words in a novel, 
Godfroid et al., 2018), we focus on global (i.e., aggregate) caption reading behaviors and global video 
comprehension to align the present study with our previous work on captions (Winke et al., 2010, 2013) 
and the work by other scholars (Bisson et al., 2014). 
In these experiments, we used an EyeLink 1000 desk-mounted eye-tracking camera sampling at 1000 Hz 
(SR Research Ltd.) to observe caption reading behavior. Additional details can be found in the Appendix. 
Materials 
Video 
For both experiments, we used a 4-minute 37-second video clip from a nature documentary, originally 
produced in English (also used by Winke et al., 2010, 2013). The subject matter was a story about wild 
bears, and it concerned a particular bear that was protecting her cubs from another bear. The video featured 
narration as well as on-camera commentary from a biologist. For Experiment 1, we translated and re-
recorded the narration in Spanish (with a female voice actor) and added Spanish captions. For Experiment 
2, we added captions in English to the original movie clip.

Comprehension Test 
In both experiments, comprehension was measured by asking participants to recall the story and type a 
detailed summary. No time limit was given; most participants took 15–20 minutes. Participants could write 
in whichever language they wished. Following Winke et al. (2013), responses were scored polytomously 
(0–0.5–1) by idea units (K = 36; to read more on idea unit scoring, see Winke & Gass, 2016). 
Working Memory Test 
We used a reading span (RSPAN) test2 to capture verbal WM, computer-delivered via E-Prime 2.0 software 
(Psychological Software Tools) and described in Conway et al. (2005; for further description, see the 
Appendix). 
Procedure 
We conducted the experiments one participant at a time in an eye-tracking laboratory. First, participants 
filled out a questionnaire that included information about their academic and language background. We 
began the experiment by calibrating the eye-tracker to each individual’s eye movements. Next, participants 
watched the video on a computer screen twice while we tracked eye movements. After a short break 
between viewings, we recalibrated for the participant’s eye movements. Immediately after video watching, 
participants completed the comprehension test, followed by the WM test. We compensated participants 
$20.00 USD for their time. Figure 1 is a schematic of the procedure.

Analysis 
To investigate the role of global caption reading behavior in video-based learning (RQ1), we compared 
sample means via a t test. Additionally, we computed change scores to make comparisons between first and 
second viewing caption reading measures. For the remaining RQs, which focus on the role of WM and 
global caption reading behaviors, we calculated descriptive statistics for all measures. We used Pearson 
correlations to examine relationships among the variables. To further explore these relationships, we 
divided the samples into (a) high and low WM and (b) high and low video-comprehension groups (Payne 
& Ross, 2005). As these subgroups were small, we used a Wilcoxon rank sum test (Mann-Whitney U), a 
nonparametric analogue to the two-sample t test. The effect size related to this test was reported as r. 
To investigate how the participants used or read the captions when they were on screen, we created a 
rectangular area of interest (AOI) and several interest periods where and when (respectively) captions 
appeared on the screen. EyeLink software recorded the location and duration of eye fixations within the 
captions’ AOI and interest periods. In both experiments, we used three global eye-tracking metrics, 
aggregated across captions in each viewing, to calculate attention and reading within the caption area AOIs: 
• Percent Caption Viewing Time is the proportion of time a participant spends looking at captions (in 
ms) in relation to the total amount of time captions are on screen. A person who does not read the 
90 Language Learning & Technology 
 
captions very often has a low percentage, while a person who makes frequent use of the captions a 
has a high percentage. 
• First Pass Time is a metric used to demonstrate initial or early attention to an AOI (Conklin & 
Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). Thus, we use First Pass Time to measure early or first, sustained attention 
to captions. This is the amount of time (in ms) participants spend reading an individual caption area 
before their gaze passes out of the caption area. The time of subsequent revisits to the AOI are not 
counted in this metric. 
• Rereading Time is an eye-tracking metric “that signals more effortful and/or conscious processing” 
in reading (Conkin & Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016, p. 455). In this study, Rereading Time is the total 
amount of time (in ms) participants spend reading a caption after the first pass. For example, a 
participant may read a caption when it first appears, then look at an object in the video, and then 
reread the caption while it is still on the screen. This measure plus First Pass Time constitutes the 
total gaze duration. However, in this study, we are more interested in first pass and rereading 
separately, because they may indicate caption reading intentionality (first pass) and overall 
sustained caption use (rereading). 
Experiment 1. Spanish Language Learners 
Participants, Materials, and Procedures Unique to Experiment 1 
Forty-six learners of Spanish (32 female) enrolled in fourth-semester courses at a large U.S. university 
participated in Experiment 1. They were undergraduate students pursuing 29 different academic 
specializations, with a mean age of 20.04 years (SD = 1.86); all participants but one (a Russian speaker) 
were native speakers of English. 
We assigned the participants randomly to either a caption group (n = 23) or a no-caption group (n =23). 
The caption group watched a video with Spanish captions while the non-caption group watched the same 
video without captions. As illustrated in Figure 1, each participant watched the video two times. 
On the free-recall comprehension test, the participants were free to write in English, their first language, or 
in Spanish. Two researchers scored the comprehension tests, and a third person adjudicated in case of 
discrepancies. The inter-rater reliability (total score correlation) was .98 before third ratings. For the 
Spanish version of the video, we set up 42 AOIs, synced to the times in which the captions were on the 
screen. 
Experiment 1 Results and Discussion 
RQ1. Captions Improve Video-Based Learning 
We first investigated whether those who saw the videos with captions understood more (n = 23, Mrecall = 
8.27, SD = 4.16, min = 2.00, max = 16.25) than those who saw the videos without captions (n = 23, Mrecall 
= 2.59, SD = 2.12, min = 0.00, max = 7.00). This difference was statistically significant (d = 1.72, t = 5.83, 
df = 32.2, p = 0.001). This result aligns previous research on whether captions aid in video comprehension. 
With this confirmatory evidence of captions’ beneficial effects on comprehension, we shifted our focus to 
better understanding the relations among WM, caption reading behavior, and video comprehension. In 
Table 1, we list recall test results, eye tracking metrics (First Pass Time in ms, and Rereading Time in ms), 
and RSPAN scores for those who saw the videos with captions. Change scores illustrate differences in 
caption reading behavior across the two viewings, Time 1 (T1) and Time 2 (T2). On average, this group, 
who watched the videos with captions, showed little change from T1 to T2, though there was considerable 
variation among the participants.

As a preliminary analysis to explore the relationships among recall, WM, and caption reading behaviors, 
we ran Pearson product-moment correlations (see Table 2). Aside from inter-dependent caption reading 
measures, we found few substantial correlations among the variables. More interesting were how 
comprehension (Recall) and WM (RSPAN) were related to caption reading behaviors. We did not find 
statistically significant results (meaning we cannot generalize these data beyond the current dataset), but, 
within this dataset, viewing captions, and particularly rereading them during T2, was negatively associated 
(although not significantly) with Recall scores to a small degree (r = -.22). WM also had small, negative 
correlations with rereading measures: -.21 for T1, and -.34 for T2.

RQ2. Working Memory and Video-Based L2 Comprehension 
Seeing that verbal WM and video comprehension (recall) had a weak correlation (r = .16), we next explored 
comprehension differences between learners with relatively low WM and learners with relatively high WM. 
We created two subgroups within the caption group: high WM (top third, n = 8, MWM = 64.50, SDWM = 
4.87, Mrecall = 8.78, SDrecall = 2.29) and low WM (bottom third, n = 8, MWM = 41.00, SDWM = 7.27, Mrecall = 
6.38, SDrecall = 5.25). The groups were significantly different in their verbal WM (W = 0, p < .001, r = .83), 
but there were no substantial differences on free-recall scores between the two groups, with the difference 
being small and not statistically significant (Wilcoxon rank sum test: W = 22.5, Z = 0.63, p = 0.528, r = 
92 Language Learning & Technology 
 
0.16). These data show that there were several participants with low WM who nonetheless were successful 
in summarizing (recalling) content from the video. 
RQ3. Working Memory and Caption-Reading Behavior 
To address RQ3 concerning the relationship between WM and caption reading, we first calculated 
descriptive statistics (see Table 3), of three eye-movement measures for the high- and low-WM groups. 
In terms of total time spent reading captions, the high-WM group spent less time on T1 compared to the 
low-WM group, but this difference was neither statistically significant (W = 40, p = 0.431) nor particularly 
large (r = -0.20). However, the two groups moved in opposite directions during T2. The high-WM group 
spent slightly less time reading captions while the low-WM group attended to them more. While the two 
groups were not significantly different in their change scores (W = 47, p = .128), for this group of learners 
the effect was medium sized (r = -0.38). 
We next observed that the differences in caption reading appeared to be associated with rereading, our 
measure of sustained caption use. Average First Pass Times for the groups did not differ on T1 (W = 32, p 
= 1, r = 0), nor was there a difference in change scores on First Pass Time (W = 36, p = .713, r = -.09). In 
average Rereading Times, however, there was an appreciable but non-significant difference at T1 (W = 21, 
p = .270, r = 0.28). Changes in rereading behavior from T1 to T2 at the group level were visible (i.e., a 
mean of -28.10 ms for the high-WM group and 45.60 ms for the low-WM group), but ultimately neither 
statistically nor practically significant (W = 35, p = .793, r = -.07). Again, we noted large individual 
variation in Rereading Times across the two groups.

RQ4. Caption-Reading Behavior and Video-Based L2 Comprehension 
To explore the relationship between caption-reading behavior and video-based L2 comprehension, we 
divided the caption group into two subgroups (top third and bottom third) based on the free-recall test 
scores: A high-comprehension group (n = 9, M = 12.64, SD = 2.24) and a low-comprehension group (n = 
8, M = 4.19, SD = 1.86; see Table 4). The difference between the two groups’ free-recall test scores was 
statistically significant (W = .00, Z = -3.48, p = .001, r = .84). 
Table 4 presents descriptive statistics of the high- and low-comprehension groups’ caption-reading 
behaviors. The high-comprehension group’s Percent Caption Viewing Time and First Pass Time were 
longer than the low-comprehension group; however, these differences were small and not significantly 
different (Percent Caption Viewing Time: W = 33, p = .810, r = .06; First Pass Time: W = 31, p = .665, r 
= .11). The high-comprehension group’s Rereading Time was appreciably shorter than that of the low-
Susan Gass, Paula Winke, Daniel R. Isbell, and Jieun Ahn 93 
 
comprehension group, but this difference was non-significant (W = 48, p = .136, r = -.37).

Looking at changes in caption viewing from T1 to T2, the two groups trended in opposite directions in 
terms of Percent Caption Viewing Time: The high-comprehension group spent less time while the low-
comprehension group spent more time. This difference, however, was neither significant nor very large (W 
= 45, p = .413, r = -.20). The high-comprehension group spent less time on the first pass reading and less 
time rereading. Conversely, the low-comprehension group spent more time on first pass reading and more 
time rereading during T2 than T1. These differences were not statistically significant, but for the change in 
First Pass Time, the effect size was r = -.28 (W = 48, p = .269). The change in Rereading Time had an effect 
size of r = -.13 (W = 42, p = .597). 
Below we summarize the findings from Experiment 1: 
• RQ1 - Captions promoted L2 video comprehension. 
• RQ2 - Individual differences in verbal WM had little to no effect on video comprehension. 
• RQ3 - Individual differences in verbal WM had some effects on caption-reading behavior. High-
WM learners appeared to spend less time reading captions during T2 and appeared to spend less 
time rereading captions in general. 
• RQ4 - Learners with relatively low comprehension (low recall scores) spent more time rereading 
captions than high-comprehension learners. 
Experiment 2. English Language Learners 
Participants, Materials, and Procedures Unique to Experiment 2 
Twenty-four English learners (16 female) at the same large U.S. university participated in Experiment 2. 
We recruited them from an intensive English program (n = 5) or credit-bearing English for academic 
purposes courses (n = 19; undergraduates = 12, graduate students = 7). Participants’ fields of study 
represented a broad range, from music to epidemiology. Their ages ranged from 18 to 28, with a mean age 
of 20.96 years (SD = 2.96). The group consisted of 15 Chinese speakers (1 also reporting Taiwanese as an 
L1), 5 Arabic speakers, 2 Malay speakers, 1 Urdu speaker, and 1 Bengali speaker. 
As in Experiment 1, Experiment 2 participants followed the procedures in Figure 1, except we only showed 
them videos with captions. For the English video, there were 49 captions and corresponding AOIs. On the 
recall test, the participants wrote what they recalled from the video using English or their native language. 
Non-English responses were translated by native speakers into English. Two raters scored the responses by 
94 Language Learning & Technology 
 
consensus; recall scores had an internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) of .77. 
Because administration of the RSPAN in English for non-native speakers represents a considerable threat 
to reliability (Sanchez et al., 2010), we worked with applied linguists who were bilinguals, and we oversaw 
their translation of the RSPAN into Simplified Mandarin Chinese and Modern Standard Arabic for the 
Chinese and Arabic speakers in this study (for details, see the Appendix). The KR-21 reliability index for 
all translated RSPANs was .86 (n = 19). 
Experiment 2 Results and Discussion 
Descriptive statistics for the recall, WM, and caption viewing measures are in Table 5. All participants 
successfully completed the recall test; 5 participants (all L1 Chinese) recalled in their native language. For 
the RSPAN, only 19 participants were able to take a version of the test in their L1. One participant’s eyes 
could not be successfully calibrated; this participant’s eye-tracking data were excluded from analysis.

The average recall score for the English learners was higher than that of the Spanish learners in Experiment 
1, likely due to differences in global language proficiency. The English learners also spent less time reading 
captions overall, compared to the Spanish learners. The participants in this experiment tended to spend 
more time reading captions during T1, but they reread for longer periods of time during T2. 
Correlations among variables are in Table 6. Comprehension (Recall) weakly correlated with most 
variables, but it correlated moderately with WM (RSPAN). WM, Percent Caption Viewing Time, and First 
Pass Time correlated moderately to strongly with each other.

RQ2. Working Memory and Video-Based L2 Comprehension 
Verbal WM had a weak correlation (r =.33) with video comprehension. To explore the differences between 
participants of distinct WM capacities, we again created high- (n = 8, MWM = 70.50, SDWM = 2.78) and low-
WM (n = 8, MWM = 51.00, SDWM = 6.85) groups (based only on those who took an L1 RSPAN test). These 
two groups had significantly different verbal WM ability (W = 64, p <.001, r = .83). 
Learners with high WM performed better on the free-recall test (Mrecall = 19.44, SDrecall = 5.26) than learners 
with lower verbal WM (Mrecall = 11.75, SDrecall = 5.06), although a Wilcoxon rank sum test did not quite 
cross the threshold of statistical significance, (W = 50.5, p = .058, r = .47). 
RQ3. Working Memory and Caption-Reading Behavior 
We next calculated descriptive statistics for caption-reading behaviors of the high- and low-WM groups 
(see Table 7). The group with higher verbal WM spent more time reading captions during T1 compared to 
the low-WM group, but a Wilcoxon rank sum test showed this was not a significant difference (W = 41.00, 
p = 0.147, r = .36). For First Pass Time T1, the high-WM group spent more time than the low-WM group 
did, but this difference was not statistically significant (W = 39.00, p = .224, r = .30). Similarly, the high-
WM group’s larger mean of caption Rereading Time during T1 was not significantly larger than the low-
WM group’s mean (W = 36, p = .385, r = .22).

Looking at the changes in caption reading behavior on T2, the high-WM group reduced their Percent 
Caption Viewing Time, while the low-WM group largely viewed the captions for a similar proportion of 
time. This difference in caption viewing changes was small and not statistically significant (W = 20.5, p 
= .416, r = -.20). Both groups reduced their First Pass Time (and to a similar degree) on T2 (W = 24, p 
= .685, r = -.10). The high-WM group reduced their average reading time on T2, while the low-WM group 
increased their average reading time on T2, but the differences between the high- and low-WM groups 
behaviors was small (r = -.25) and not statistically significant (W = 19, p = .325). 
RQ4. Caption-Reading Behavior and Video-Based L2 Comprehension 
Overall, most of the caption reading variables correlated weakly with comprehension (measured via free 
recall), and none of these correlations were statistically significant. However, what participants did during 
T2 was interesting: Participants who spent less gaze time on captions on T2 (Percent Caption Viewing Time 
on the first pass) tended to exhibit greater video comprehension. 
To further explore this trend, we created two subgroups based on high and low recall scores, with the middle 
third of participants excluded. The high-comprehension group (n = 8, M = 22.12, SD = 2.33) recalled almost 
twice as much story content than did the low-comprehension group (n = 8, M = 11.31, SD = 2.62), and this 
difference was significant (W = 64, p < .001, r = .83). Descriptive statistics of the caption reading measures 
for each group are in Table 8. Both the high- and low-comprehension groups had similar behaviors in terms 
of overall caption viewing time, with each group spending less time on captions during T2. On T1, the 
groups exhibited similar caption reading behavior, with no visible or statistically significant differences in 
Percent Caption Viewing Time (W = 34, p = .874, r = .04), First Pass Time (W = 33, p = .958, r = .01), or 
Rereading Time (W = 33, p = .958, r = .01).

The two groups showed similar patterns of change in caption reading behavior on T2, with Percent Caption 
Viewing Times and First Pass Times dropping noticeably while Rereading Times changing relatively little. 
For Percent Caption Viewing Time, the high-comprehension group exhibited a slightly larger reduction, 
but this difference was not statistically significant (W = 22, p = .317, r = -.25). Similarly, a significant 
difference was not found for First Pass Times (W = 23, p = .372) across the groups, despite a visibly larger 
reduction for the high-comprehension group (r = -.22). There was no significant or substantial difference 
in Rereading-Time changes between the two groups (W = 31, p = .958, r = -.01). 
Below is a summary of the findings from Experiment 2: 
• RQ2 - Individual differences in verbal WM had a medium effect on video comprehension, as 
measured by free recall. 
Susan Gass, Paula Winke, Daniel R. Isbell, and Jieun Ahn 97 
 
• RQ3 - Individual differences in verbal WM had small effects on caption-reading behavior. High-
WM learners spent more time reading captions (First Pass Time) and then rereading captions on 
T1. High-WM learners also tended to reduce their caption reading to a greater degree than low-
WM learners on T2. 
• RQ4 - Learners with high- and low-comprehension (recall scores) had similar caption reading 
behaviors on T1. However, the high-comprehension group showed greater reduction in their overall 
caption reading time and their First Pass Time on T2 compared to the low-comprehension group. 
Discussion 
The purpose of the present study was to situate the use of captions within the broader field of SLA as well 
as in general learning theories. RQ1 (Experiment 1) confirmed previous work in which captions generally 
promoted L2 video comprehension. The other three RQs investigated individual differences (WM capacity) 
in samples from two different populations: Spanish foreign language learners and ESL learners. In 
Experiment 1, we focused on foreign language learners (learners with limited exposure to the language), 
and in Experiment 2, we researched L2 learners who were immersed in input-rich environments.  
The first of the common RQs focused on the effect of an individual’s verbal WM capacity on captioned-
video comprehension, measured by a free-recall task following the watching of a short captioned video. 
We found that the two samples investigated in our study differed in that there was little effect of WM for 
the Spanish L2 learners, whereas there was a medium effect for the ESL learners. As noted earlier, the 
general proficiency of the ESL learners was assumed to be higher than that of the Spanish learners, 
supported by the fact that the recall scores of the ESL learners were higher than those of the Spanish 
learners. Although proficiency level was not featured in our RQs, we concur with Mirzaei et al. (2017) that 
it is an important variable in captioning research. 
Proficiency level must be considered to fully understand how WM capacity impacts comprehension from 
video-based listening. In our literature review, we alluded to the idea that there might be a zone within 
which captions are most useful to individual learners, a zone in which the concepts referenced and the 
language used in the video are neither too far above nor too far below a learner’s comprehension level. 
What we propose is that one needs to be at a certain level of proficiency before differences in WM capacity 
play a significant role in the comprehension of the video. In other words, there is a proficiency threshold 
(as described by Mirzaei et al., 2017) after which WM becomes relevant. At lower levels of proficiency, 
most of the effort in comprehending comes at a very basic level which consists of word-by-word 
interpretation (Leveridge & Yang, 2013; Pujola, 2002). It may be difficult to use individual words to create 
a meaningful stretch of speech; memory, therefore, may not be relevant, and one’s WM capacity seems not 
to differentiate learners. But when closer to the proficiency threshold, WM does seem to differentiate 
learners’ comprehension of captioned videos. 
We further investigated the role of verbal WM and its effects on caption-reading behavior (RQ3). 
Interesting differences were found based on T1 versus T2 of watching the video. If WM played a role, one 
might expect that those with higher WM scores would spend less time reading captions during T2 given 
that one might be able to recall the text. In fact, for both groups (Spanish and ESL), behaviors were similar. 
When we looked at behavior at T2, the reading behavior of the Spanish and ESL learners was similar. The 
two WM groups went in opposite directions: the high groups reduced their caption reading time, whereas 
the low-WM groups increased their reading time. While these results are potentially interesting, we are 
cautious in our interpretation of their importance. We can only talk about a trend, but the trend does coincide 
with a review by Desjarlais (2017) who summarized L1 research on multimedia learning and suggested that 
individual differences, including WM, account for variation in information processing during multimedia 
learning (p. 131). A more robust sample size would likely reveal greater differences between those with 
low and those with high WM capacity. 
RQ4 considered the relationship between comprehension and the behaviors that participants demonstrated 
98 Language Learning & Technology 
 
while reading captions. We focused on the changes in reading behaviors from T1 to T2. In the Spanish L2 
group, high-comprehension learners spent less time overall reading captions (First Pass Time) and less time 
rereading than the low-comprehension group, perhaps taking more from the audio or from the visuals than 
from the captions. For the ESL group, there were fewer differences between the high- and low-
comprehension groups, perhaps reflecting their higher proficiency as well as their experiences living in an 
English-speaking country. They had learned to balance the multiple sources of input. In this study, we 
considered individual differences in WM capacity, specific reading behaviors when reading, and how those 
behaviors might relate to comprehension. 
From prior research, we know that when viewers have enough experience with captions so that splitting 
their attention among the multiple-modes of input is not overly taxing (Ayres & Sweller, 2014), captions 
will be mostly beneficial, and will help viewers parse and understand the incoming speech stream. Our data 
support this perspective. Proficiency level (corresponding to experience) differences were found to impact 
two factors. First, those at higher levels of proficiency were differentiated by their WM capacity. In other 
words, once learners were able to balance multiple input sources, other individual characteristics came into 
play. Second, the two ESL groups (high- and low-comprehension) demonstrated little difference in their 
reading behaviors between T1 and T2. Experience in viewing captioned videos allowed them to create a 
more balanced approach to using multiple sources of input. 
However, our results showed an apparent contradiction in the effect of WM capacity on video 
comprehension. The WM capacity of the Spanish L2 learners did not impact comprehension, whereas it 
had a medium effect on comprehension for the ESL learners. In other words, learners used captions 
regardless of their WM capacities, but the caption use likely depended in part on the learners’ WM 
capacities and their L2 proficiency levels relative to the video content. WM capacity also appeared to be 
related to differences in caption reading behavior. With the English learners, WM capacity seemed to affect 
how they used captions in their second viewing: L2 learners with higher WM capacity did not use the 
captions as much as those with lower WM capacity. They might have been more able to hold key 
information effectively in the episodic buffer during T1 and, therefore, they might have gleaned more of 
the needed information from the captions the first time around. 
Our data also show that captions are a powerful visual attraction even if one does not need them. High-WM 
learners tended to spend less time reading captions at T2, and less time reading captions in general, but they 
still read them, even if they might not have needed to. Captions appeared to be a more helpful processing 
aid to learners with lower comprehension relative to the difficulty level of the video. Captions seemed to 
provide important visual scaffolding that could be used to confirm only partially-acquired knowledge or to 
fill gaps in knowledge, such that a more complete picture could be obtained and retained. 
To answer the larger question here, How do captions help people learn languages?, our results suggest that 
captions help with attentional control. In other words, the physical presence of written material on the screen 
provides an attention-drawing device in a way that normal spoken text, for example, does not. This salient, 
attention-grabbing written information is useful particularly when other information, such as aural 
information, becomes too difficult (i.e., high cognitive-load bearing) and, thereby, not accessible. Evidence 
for this claim came from learners in our study with more limited WM capacities who tended to use captions 
more. As explained by Wiley et al. (2014), “Learning from multimedia is a higher-order cognitive process 
that relies on many subprocesses to be successful” (p. 598). In their view, WM limitations are one of the 
primary motivations for using multimedia instruction. It can neutralize WM’s limiting effects on learning. 
In relation to general learning theory, we believe, as Plass and Jones (2005) suggested, that captions add 
yet another medium to the already complex picture of how language learners can benefit from multimedia 
input. Within multimedia learning, the assumption is that visual and aural input support one another. 
Learning is, therefore, aided because there are multiple sources to draw on for comprehension, reducing the 
burden of relying on only one source (Mayer, 2014). Multimedia learning must be designed in line with 
how the human mind works and, in the case of L2 learning, of how learning takes place. As Mayer (2014) 
stated, “[a] fundamental hypothesis underlying research on multimedia learning is that multimedia 
Susan Gass, Paula Winke, Daniel R. Isbell, and Jieun Ahn 99 
 
instructional messages that are designed in light of how the human mind works are more likely to lead to 
meaningful learning than those that are not so designed” (p. 43). Thus, reflecting on this research, and also 
taking into account Vanderplank’s (2016a) view that captioned videos may work best when language 
learners are watching videos that match “their level of interest and their own level of proficiency in the 
foreign language” (p. 188), we conclude that captions most certainly aid comprehension, but the captioned 
multimedia must be chosen carefully by teachers. They have to be matched with the language learners’ 
proficiency levels (Winke et al., 2010, 2013), and one must also consider the L1–L2 relationship. They also 
have to be chosen in consideration of learners’ prior experience in learning with captioned multimedia. 
Finally, their use must be integrated into robust task-design. Most beneficially, captions appear to help 
counter-balance individual differences in cognitive processing ability, especially when learners are 
appropriately challenged (i.e., are viewing videos they can engage in and that are at the right difficulty 
level) and are motivated to learn from the videos. When comprehension is relatively high and strains on 
cognitive processing are not too great, captions support learning. Learners maximally use captions (for 
learning) when they perceive gaps in the aural input and use captions as a scaffold to figure out, reinforce, 
or confirm the aural input’s meaning. The process of using captions to fill knowledge gaps (see Swain & 
Lapkin, 1995) in aural input helps learners with overall L2 vocabulary and forms (see Montero Perez, 
Peters, & Desmet, 2015; Sydorenko, 2010) and helps them, when they are successful in the gap-filling, 
improve their overall L2 comprehension. 
Limitations 
Our study had several limitations. Both of our experiments were small-scale and lab-based. We used short 
video clips in an eye-tracking lab. As demonstrated by Rodgers and Webb (2017), and as called upon by 
Vanderplank (2016a, 2016b), more longitudinal (and longer viewing time) research on captions is needed. 
Also, investigations into caption use by language learners in more natural (out-of-class) contexts are 
needed. Research in which language learners are asked to watch videos with the ability to voluntarily switch 
captions off or on would be informative, as caption-use information connected to WM capacities and 
proficiency could shed more light on what people do with captions to learn. Finally, we did not have a pre-
experiment measure of proficiency. Instead, we relied on impressionistic observations, supported by 
evidence from recall scores. A next step is to observe how language learners with various cognitive-
processing levels (relative to their peers) benefit from captions, but with the difficulty level of the captioned 
video matched to the general proficiency of the learners. Prior research studies on the benefits of captions 
relative to proficiency level (e.g., Leveridge & Yang, 2013; Lwo & Lin, 2012; Montero Perez et al., 2013; 
Neuman & Koskinen, 1992; Pujola, 2002; Taylor, 2005; Vanderplank, 1988) have only had the language 
learners, and not a set of videos, vary in terms of the trait of proficiency, and most certainly, any video itself 
can be rated and categorized on an external proficiency scale as well. A promising research direction is that 
taken by Mirzaei et al. (2017), who investigated learners’ uses of smart captions: in our study, we only 
looked at full captions. Certainly, research on caption types and caption creation in relation to students’ 
proficiency levels and individual differences is necessary. Researchers need to understand the complex 
interactions among the learners’ proficiency levels, the captioned videos’ difficulty levels, and the 
individuals’ motivations and goals in watching (in connection with their cognitive abilities in multimodal 
processing) to fully understand how (and why and when) captioned-video enhances the L2 acquisition 
process. 
In terms of analysis, we wish to emphasize two points. First, the sample sizes in both experiments were 
small, which only allowed us to conduct simple correlational and non-parametric analyses, limiting the 
causal interpretations and extrapolation of results. Second, our decision to carve out subgroups for WM and 
comprehension for exploratory analyses compromised the quality of those measures: continuous data were 
flattened into crude categories. While we found these subgroup analyses informative, as they showed how 
learners with measurable differences might interact with captioned videos, it made it more difficult to 
generalize the results. Future studies involving WM and captioned video comprehension would 
undoubtedly benefit from larger samples and more rigorous statistical analysis.

Conclusion 
Mayer (2014, p. 44) emphasized the need for an “evidenced-based theory of multimedia learning” that can 
guide designers in the creation of effective multimedia. Understanding how multimedia input is processed 
by L2 and foreign language learners and understanding the role of WM capacity in relation to multimedia 
use are central to understanding the important role of captions in video-based listening, and hence 
captioning’s role in language learning. In previous research, researchers have considered what it is that 
learners focus on during captioned-video watching, but in this study, we wanted to shed light on how 
captions help people learn during captioned-video watching.  
Investigating caption use by L2 and foreign language learners is well situated within multimedia learning 
theories. The next steps should be to better contextualize captioned learning material within language 
learning proficiency development and instruction. 
Notes 
1. In this article, we differentiate between captions and subtitles. The latter are in a different language than 
the language of the audio. Captions, on the other hand, are in the same language and are commonly 
used in language classes. 
2. Two other WM tests were delivered to the participants, a visuospatial test (Experiment 1) and an 
operation span test (Experiment 2). In this article, we limit the discussion to the RSPAN because of its 
strong correlation with other measures of interest.

Appendix. Additional Details on the Methodology and Procedures 
RSPAN Description 
Participants sat at a computer and read increasingly long sets of sentences, with each sentence within a set 
presented one at a time. After a sentence appeared, participants indicated (by pressing a key) whether or 
not it made sense (some sentences had nonsense elements which rendered the sentence absurd), and then 
the participant saw a letter. After a subset of sentences and letters were presented, the participant had to 
recall the string of letters, in the correct order. The largest span of letters from the largest sentence-set one 
could remember correctly is his or her reading span score. Conway et al. (2005, p. 776) reported an internal 
consistency of .79 for the RSPAN when using the partial scoring method.Because the WM model we were 
using involved processing as an important component, we used the participants’ plausibility judgments to 
ensure that they processed the sentences. Following Service, Simola, Metsänheimo, and Maury (2002), we 
modified some of the sentences so that implausibility was not apparent until the final two words (see Gass 
& Lee, 2011). 
Eye-Tracking Details 
For each experiment, we loaded the videos into an eye-tracking experiment file. A rectangular interest area 
was created and positioned to encompass all the captions in the video (for the captioned video). 
Additionally, we set up timed interest periods that we synced with the times in which captions were on the 
screen. This allowed us to extract total gaze times on the captions only when they were on screen. 
During data collection, participants were seated 55 centimeters away from the computer monitor. They 
placed their head against a forehead rest and used a chin rest. We tracked their right eye (as described by 
and previously done by Holmqvist et al., 2011; Winke, Godfroid, & Gass, 2013). Although we carefully 
calibrated participants’ eyes to the screen before each viewing of the video, eye drift was an issue due to 
the long viewing time. We watched for clear patterns of reading (i.e., word-to-word horizontal saccades) as 
well as eye-focus on action sequences (e.g., bears running along a riverbank) to ensure that a person’s eye 
calibration was not drifting off. When we did see drift, we marked that on paper, and after data collection, 
we conducted individual eye-washing: that is, we manually moved the areas of interest in relation to the 
eye-movements on screen for that individual to correct for his or her actual drift during the experiment.

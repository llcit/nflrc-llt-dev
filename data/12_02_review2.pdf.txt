Review by Jody Gabler, American University 
Computers have come to play a role in nearly every aspect of our day-to-day lives, certainly including 
education.  In the arena of second language instruction, computers enable learners to interact with others 
and become engaged in lessons in new and meaningful ways (Warschauer, 2006). In A Practical Guide to 
Using Computers in Language Teaching, John de Szendeffy provides a user-friendly look at how 
computer technology can be integrated into the classroom, regardless of the instructor’s previous 
experience with computers. 
Teachers who are new to using technology in their instruction seem to be the book’s primary audience, 
although teachers and administrators of all backgrounds can find useful information and ideas to add to 
their program. The book’s scope is wide in that it provides information on several topics, such as 
background on Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL), technical advice, tips for classroom 
management in a computer lab, and advice for selection of an appropriate computer system for a 
particular program. Furthermore, the author provides a framework for numerous lesson and project ideas 
that would work best in academic programs for teens or adults (although these could easily be adapted for 
younger students or adult education programs). While the book is probably most suitable to those 
programs that have a computer lab or multiple computers, de Szendeffy does give some ideas for classes 
in which there might only be one computer available.   
The book is divided into four sections. The first section of the book, entitled "What Is Computer-Assisted 
Language Learning?" is an important beginning for teachers or administrators who are not convinced of 
the rationale of using computers in the classroom, or for those who have little experience with teaching or 
technology. The first chapter of the section explains that computers are very effective for encouraging 
language use and practice in the classroom. The author gives a brief history of language teaching 
methodology and explains how particular technologies worked well with particular methods, e.g. 
audiocassettes were a natural complement to the audiolingual approach, allowing learners to listen and 
repeat chunks of language. The history overview culminates in the present day, with a preferred 
methodology of integrated lessons in which learners complete authentic tasks or projects using multiple

 language skills (Brown, 2000). These lessons can be enhanced by the use of computers, de Szendeffy 
claims, because computers can be used for realistic tasks, such as writing up an interview, preparing for a 
trip, or chatting online, which require students to use multiple language skills and interact.  
An important emphasis in the first section (and throughout the book) is that computers need to be used 
alongside—not in place of—a human teacher. De Szendeffy points out that many language-learning 
software programs are marketed as stand-alone tools for learning a new language. While these software 
packages may contain good self-access material to help learners practice on their own, they do not 
encourage students to interact with each other and the instructor in the target language and are therefore 
unlikely to fit well into a course’s curriculum (Swain & Lapkin, 1998). Instead, de Szendeffy explains 
that by implementing ideas from his "activities" section, teachers can use much less sophisticated (and 
less costly) computer programs, such as word processors and web browsers, to complement their lessons 
and engage students in authentic ways. This information is certainly useful for program administrators 
and teachers who are faced with the challenge of choosing software programs for their courses.  
The first section also includes a list of tips for integrating computers into the classroom. For example, de 
Szendeffy tells readers to "prepare and be patient" (p. 20), "pace activities" (p. 23), and "orchestrate 
communicative activities" (p. 26) when working with computers.  To those instructors who have received 
extensive training in second language teaching, this information may seem obvious. On the other hand, it 
may help teachers to see that incorporating computers into their lessons does not require them to 
fundamentally change the way they teach, but simply to add a new tool. As for TESOL students or 
inexperienced teachers, these suggestions can reinforce the principles of good teaching that they are 
learning and help them see how to apply those principles to technology-based lessons (Brown, 2000). 
The book’s second part, entitled "CALL Classroom Activities" is a very practical and extensive list of 
activity ideas whose content could be adapted to fit a wide array of classes. The section is broken into six 
chapters, each of which focuses on a different skills area or type of activity.  
Chapter 4 deals with writing activities, beginning with lessons on how to use a word processor and 
building to more complex tasks, such as writing up an interview, writing a story, and writing a business 
letter. This chapter could easily be used to create a writing course curriculum. By following the 
sequencing of lessons in this chapter, course designers can build scaffolding and incorporate prior 
knowledge into the course automatically, helping students learn the information more efficiently and 
experience success (Hammond, 2001; Numelin, 1998). Alternatively, individual activities could easily be 
selected from this section and used to complement a particular lesson or fill gaps in a pre-existing 
curriculum.  
Chapter 5 gives ten different ideas for how to use the Internet in structured activities.  Some of these 
activities focus on personal communication via the web, such as talking to keypals (Internet penpals), 
using Internet chats, and sending electronic postcards. In these activities, students can interact with their 
classmates, the instructor, another group of students, or native speakers whom the teacher has selected to 
complete the tasks. The chapter also offers ideas for teaching effective use of web browsers through 
authentic tasks that learners may need to accomplish in their lives outside of class. These include 
researching current events, finding an apartment, learning about field trip destinations, and researching 
colleges online. 
In chapter 6 on audio/video activities, de Szendeffy argues that computers provide students and teachers 
with greater control, access, and integration of material than older tape recorders or videocassettes. This 
chapter gives useful information on how to digitize material and easily create recordings for activities, 
such as dictation or oral comprehension questions. Readers also obtain good suggestions for listening 
activity material, such as online broadcasts, TV advertisements, and students’ own recorded speech. 
These ideas help incorporate more aural activities into a class and move away from all-written tasks,

which is especially important in a conversation or pronunciation course (Avery & Ehrlich, 1992; Celce-
Murcia, Brinton, & Goodwin, 1996).  
Chapter 7 gives the reader numerous ideas for long-term projects. Again, de Szendeffy has sequenced the 
activities to provide excellent scaffolding using realistic tasks. The projects offer ideas on designing and 
evaluating web pages, creating class books, creating videos and slideshows, and conducting surveys. This 
chapter is an excellent starting point for a curriculum designer, because each project idea includes many 
components that could be completed over the length of an entire course, providing the foundation for a 
course curriculum. 
Chapters 8 and 9 are both relatively short, dealing with text-based activities and content activities, 
respectively. These chapters provide useful information about resources that teachers could pass along to 
students, such as online corpora, online learning sources, and lists of software programs. These ideas may 
be more difficult to incorporate into class lessons because they do not offer as much information on what 
students will actually do with the listed resources. To its credit, chapter 9 provides an extensive list of 
software and online programs that may be useful to teachers when preparing for their own lessons, or for 
administrators when making curricular or program-wide decisions about technology. 
All of the activity chapters follow an easy-to-use format beginning with a brief introduction including key 
questions the chapter will answer, general information about the chapter’s activities, and a rationale for 
using that type of activity in the classroom. The remainder of the chapter outlines each activity, including 
the computer skills needed by the teacher, the student level, the content objectives, the necessary 
software, and instructions for teacher preparation and student instruction. Table 1 and the following bullet 
points show an example of this layout for a short writing activity from Chapter 4 (pp. 45-46). 
Table 1. Sample Activity Format 
Activity 6: Interview 
Teacher skills: word processing, using a spell-checker and a thesaurus 
Student level: high-beginning to advanced 
Content objective: interviewing, note-taking, writing interviews 
Software: word processor 
 
At the beginning of the semester an interview activity can serve as an icebreaker while reinforcing word-
processing skills and formatting conventions. Students interview each other in pairs or in a chain where a 
interviews b who interviews a. The subject can be simply biographical or a position on a topic and can 
become part of a class book later in the semester (see Chapter 7, Project Activities: Class Books on page 
139). 
 
Teacher Preparation 
 Assign pairs or groups to interview each other. 
 Give students hints on questions and demonstrate how to ask follow-up questions. 
 Show them examples of how to take quick notes without taking dictation. 
 
Steps for Students 
 Interview your partner or group members. 
 Take notes but not dictation. 
 Type up the interview, observing the formatting guidelines learned in Activity 2. 
 Give a draft of your interview to your interviewee so he or she can check it for accuracy and 
comment. 
 Correct your draft.

 Save the interview file for a possible class book later. 
In his activity instructions, de Szendeffy includes technical notes, examples, possible technology glitches 
and how to work around them, tips for classroom management, and pictures of what will appear on the 
computer screen. These additional notes are very helpful for teachers who are not familiar with a 
particular computer program or who do not have experience working with computers in the classroom. 
The author is also careful to provide instructional steps for both Microsoft-based programs and 
Macintosh-based programs, so that activities can be easily carried out on either.   
The third part of the book, a short section entitled "Technical Considerations," is an important source for 
administrators or teachers who need to choose a computer system for a program or class. The book 
provides some basic information on the differences between available operating systems (Macintosh, 
Microsoft Windows, and Linux), and de Szendeffy explains that any of the operating systems will largely 
meet teachers’ needs despite their slight differences. For those teachers who do not have input into their 
institution’s technology choices, this chapter is largely unnecessary.   
The book ends with several appendices that may meet teachers’ specific needs, especially for those who 
have little experience with computers or those who are making program-wide decisions about computer 
use. The appendices provide information on computer terminology, options for saving and sharing files, 
proper e-mail etiquette, basics of web browsers, tips for creating websites, fair use guidelines for using 
copyrighted materials, a sample letter for gaining permission to use copyrighted material, and a CALL 
resource list. Again, these appendices contain very specific information that can serve as a reference for 
some, but are likely to be ignored by others.   
To return to the author’s goals for this book—to provide a practical and user-friendly guide to help 
teachers integrate computer technology into their language teaching— it can be concluded that those 
goals have been accomplished. The book is very easy to read and includes numerous tips and suggestions 
for those with different levels of comfort and experience with teaching and technology. The book is very 
likely to encourage teachers to try new computer programs or to use old programs in new ways for 
language learning purposes. It can also serve as a guide for those who are making program-wide decisions 
regarding technology. One drawback of the book is that, while it provides good information on many 
topics, it is unlikely that any teacher or administrator will be able to benefit from all of its sections. 
Teachers may likely find the activities section most useful and ignore the section on technical 
considerations, and administrators may likely do the opposite. Still, having a copy of the book available in 
a program library would allow both teachers and administrators to access the information they need. De 
Szendeffy clearly understands that teachers do not want to replace themselves with computers but instead 
want engaging and meaningful activities to accompany what is already taking place in the classroom, and 
he offers interesting and helpful suggestions to allow teachers to facilitate tasks and projects.

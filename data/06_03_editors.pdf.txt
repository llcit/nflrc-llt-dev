FROM THE EDITORS
Welcome to this special issue on Technology and Teacher Education. We thank Seppo
Tella and Yong Zhao who, under the tireless and talented guidance of Associate Editor
Irene Thompson, served as Guest Editors. The entire issue, including our regular
columns and book and software reviews, relates to the special topic. We think it makes a
nice "package" for our readers.
Special issues draw attention to especially important and timely topics. Future LLT
special issues include Telecollaboration (May 2003), Distance Learning (September
2003), and Global Englishes (May 2004). January 2003 and January 2004 will be
regular issues, filled with a variety of articles we trust you will find interesting and
useful.
With this issue, we have added access to the mastheads of archived issues. While the
dynamic nature of Web materials allows us to keep information current, we want to give
credit to those who have contributed to the journal as editorial board members, editors,
and designers in past years.
We would also like to thank Jennifer Leeman for her exceptional work as the Book and
Software Review Editor for the past three years. She is not really leaving, however, as
she has graciously agreed to join our Editorial Board. We are pleased to announce that
Rafael Salaberry has taken the reins from Jennifer as our new Book and Software
Review Editor and we welcome him to the LLT Editorial Staff.
Sincerely,
Mark Warschauer & Dorothy Chun

Call for Papers for Special Issue of LLT 
 
Theme: Technology and the Less Commonly Taught Languages 
 
Special Issue Editor: Irene Thompson 
 
This special issue of Language Learning & Technology will focus on the role played by educational 
technologies in the learning and teaching of LCTLs (i.e., languages other than the traditionally taught 
Western European languages such as English, French, German, and Spanish). Currently, less than ten 
percent of students enrolled in foreign language courses in the US study languages such as Arabic, Farsi, 
Pashto, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Hindi, Korean, Indonesian, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese, 
Swahili, Yoruba, and other languages critically important to US national interests. These languages are 
typologically different from English and are often written in non-Roman scripts requiring extended seat 
time to attain a working proficiency. With instruction often not offered at all, offered on an irregular 
basis, or available only at the elementary levels, technology presents a wide range of opportunities to 
develop and deliver instructional materials and methodologies based on sound empirical research.  
 
Please consult the LLT Website for general guidelines on submission (http://llt.msu.edu/contrib.html) and 
research (http://llt.msu.edu/resguide.html).  
 
Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 
• empirical studies of the impact of CALL-based materials on the acquisition of speaking, listening, 
reading, writing, vocabulary, or grammar skills at various levels of proficiency in a range of LCTLs 
• integration of authentic Internet-based materials into LCTL courses, particularly at the intermediate 
and advanced levels 
• uses of CMC to promote interactive speaking and writing in a range of LCTLs 
• studies of the effectiveness of various technological tools in improving pronunciation or listening in a  
range of LCTLs, particularly those with tonal systems 
• studies of the uses of technology in the acquisition of non-Roman scripts or in reading non-Roman 
scripts (e.g., Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, and Russian) 
• uses of various types of media in LCTL teacher education 
• uses of CMC to promote online intercultural exchanges 
• evaluation of uses of technology in self-directed study of LCTLs 
• uses of videoconferencing either for distance learning or for adding remote classes to live LCTL 
classes 
 
Please send letter of intent and 250-word abstract by June 1, 2011 to llted@hawaii.edu.

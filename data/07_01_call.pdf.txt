Call for Papers for Special Issue of LLT
Theme: Technologies and Young Learners
Guest Editors: Michele Knobel and Colin Lankshear
This special issue of Language Learning & Technology will examine creative uses of new technologies
within formal and informal settings to enhance the language and literacy development of children and
adolescents up to 18 years of age. Papers are welcome in all areas of second and foreign language
learning, and we especially welcome papers relating to the experiences of migrant and indigenous
learners in their heritage language or in the mainstream or official language(s) of the country where they
live.
While it is expected that at least some of the papers included in this special issue will deal with innovative
uses of a range of new digital technologies (e.g., e-mail, computer and video games, CD-ROM
applications), contributions are also encouraged that deal with other tools and conceptions of technology.
The latter may include conceptual papers. Possible topics include, but are not limited to
• Conceptualizing technology for mainstream language and literacy acquisition in relation to
migrants or indigenous learners
• Technology-mediated language acquisition in community/public spaces (e.g., cybercafés,
community and literacy attainment centers)
• Mainstream language learning and popular culture tools and toys
• Language learning and after-school programs that involve new technologies (e.g., Girls and Boys
Clubs, Fifth Dimension after-school programs)
• Workplaces, language learning, and new technologies (e.g., working at McDonald's)
Please send an e-mail of intent with a 250-word abstract by April 30, 2003, to Michele Knobel at
mknobel@uci.edu.

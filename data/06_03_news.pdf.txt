The University of Hawai`i National Foreign Language Resource Center engages in research and materials
development projects and conducts Summer Institutes for language professionals among its many
activities.
NFLRC GRANT CONTINUED TO 2006
In April the National Foreign Language Resource Center at the University of Hawai`i at Ma¯noa was once
again selected to serve as one of the nation's language resource centers established to improve the
teaching and learning of foreign languages, particularly less commonly taught languages, throughout the
United States. All nine current language resource centers were refunded, and three new centers were
added (the Center for Advanced Language Proficiency Education and Research at Pennsylvania State
University, the Language Resource Center for Central Asia, Azerbaijan, and Afghanistan at Indiana
University, and the Center for Applied Second Language Studies at the University of Oregon). For more
information on planned activities for the new grant cycle, visit the projects section of the NFLRC Web
site.
Richard Schmidt (Director) and Jim Yoshioka (Program Coordinator) will serve as Program Chair and
Associate Program Chair of the upcoming AAAL 2003 Conference in Arlington, Virginia. Highlights of
the conference include six plenary addresses (Patricia Duff, Joshua Fishman, Georgette Ioup, Geoffrey
Nunberg, William O'Grady, Congressman Robert Underwood), five invited colloquia ("Instructed Second
Language Acquisition," "The Discourse of Health Care Dilemmas," "Classroom Talks: A Conversation
Analytic Perspective," "Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition," & "The Development
of Academic Competence in Adolescent English Learners"), a joint AAAL/ILTA colloquium, numerous
selected papers, posters, and colloquia reflecting the diversity of applied linguistics, a publishers' exhibit,
and much more! For more information about AAAL 2003, visit the AAAL Web site (www.aaal.org).

Australian Technology Enhanced Language Learning Consortium (ATELL)
Contacts: Assoc. Prof. Mike Levy, Griffith University (michael.levy@mailbox.gu.edu.au)
Prof. Roly Sussex, The University of Queensland (r.sussex@mailbox.uq.edu.au)
ATELL is an informal collaboration of Australian language teachers and researchers involved in the
development and use of technologies in language learning. It has recently been moved to Griffith
University where Mike Levy and staff in the School of Languages & Linguistics are working on
developing the concept. This work is continuing in collaboration with the Deans of the Faculties of Arts,
Social Sciences and Humanities Language Network in Australasia (DASSH) and the Association of
Modern Language Teachers' Associations of Australia (AFMTLA). We intend to establish a network of
complementary and collaborating resources for teachers and learners in the TELL domain in schools and
tertiary institutions. The ATELL website will include information, collaboration, and resources such as:
• a register of Australian TELL experts
• a register of projects in TELL research, development & implementation
• a suite of resources for researchers
• links to other sites with TELL-related information and materials
• links to reviews of hardware, software, courseware
As the various elements are put into place, an update on progress will be given.

Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition,
University of Minnesota (CARLA)
CARLA is one of several National Language Resource Centers whose role is to improve the nation's
capacity to teach and learn foreign languages effectively. Launched in 1993 with funding from the
national Title VI Language Resource Center program of the U.S. Department of Education, CARLA's
mission is to study multilingualism and multiculturalism, develop knowledge of second language
acquisition, and advance the quality of second language teaching, learning, and assessment by conducting
research and action projects sharing research-based and other forms of knowledge across disciplines and
education systems extending, exchanging, and applying this knowledge in the wider society.
CARLA's research and action initiatives include a focus on the articulation of language instruction,
content-based language teaching through technology, culture and language studies, less commonly taught
languages, language immersion education, second language assessment, second language learning
strategies, research on pragmatics and speech acts, support for study abroad, and technology and second
language learning.
To share its latest research and program opportunities with language teachers around the country,
CARLA offers the following resources: an internationally acclaimed summer institute program for
teachers; a database which lists where less commonly taught languages are taught throughout the country;
listservs for teachers of less commonly taught languages and immersion educators; a working paper
series; conferences and workshops; and a battery of instruments in French, German, and Spanish for
assessing learners' proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening at two levels on the ACTFL
scale. Check out these and other CARLA resources on the CARLA Web site at http://carla.acad.umn.edu.

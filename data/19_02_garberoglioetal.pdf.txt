Deaf individuals frequently capitalize upon communication technologies that increase 
equitable access to communication in an ongoing, effortless manner. Those 
communication technologies create conditions that increase direct access to language and 
literacy. It is the lack of direct access to language that has been historically problematic for 
deaf individuals, contributing to English literacy achievement gaps that are evidenced in 
deaf education settings. This study explored the hypothesis that increased access to 
English through communication technologies would be related to stronger English literacy 
skills for deaf individuals. A secondary analysis approach using a longitudinal large-scale 
dataset, the second National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS2), was used to assess 
the frequency of computer-mediated communication as a predictor of English literacy 
skills in a sample of 510 deaf youths in the United States. Regression analyses 
demonstrated that deaf adolescents who e-mailed or chatted more frequently exhibited 
higher reading comprehension skills in the years ahead. These results suggest that 
communication technologies should be further explored as a potential avenue that may 
support deaf individuals’ English language and literacy development.

INTRODUCTION 
Communication technologies have qualitatively transformed communications on a global level, across 
stratifications of income, language, ethnicity, culture, and disability. Increased access to information and 
communication technologies is particularly promising for individuals and communities that are 
historically marginalized, and is said to contribute to increased equity in outcomes across gender (Khan & 
Ghadially, 2010), income and ethnicity (London, Paster, Servon, Rosner, & Wallace, 2010), and disability 
(Bowker & Tuffin, 2007). In particular, visible indicators of physical differences such as disability that 
can contribute to increased isolation are said to disappear in virtual settings, emerging globally in 
countries such as Israel (Barak & Sandovsky, 2008) and New Zealand (Bowker & Tuffin, 2002, 2007). 
Yet, disability characteristics interact with how individuals choose to use information and communication

technologies. In the US, individuals whose disability characteristics were directly tied to barriers that may 
inhibit technology use (e.g., visual impairment, difficulties typing) were less likely to use the Internet, but 
deaf individuals used the Internet as much the general population (Dobransky & Hargittai, 2006).  
Across the world, deaf individuals are more likely to utilize technologies in their everyday life when 
compared to their peers in the general population, and often emerge as early adopters of technology, 
particularly communication technologies (Barak & Sadovsky, 2008; Okuyama & Iwai, 2011; Valentine, 
Skelton, & Levy, 2006). The unique dynamics of the experience of being deaf creates a context in which 
access to communication, and the languages in which communication takes place, is complex. The 
spoken language of the environment is not always fully accessible for the deaf individual. Thus, deaf 
individuals increasingly capitalize upon technologies that enable increased equitable access to 
communication in an ongoing, effortless manner. Furthermore, communication technologies create 
conditions that increase direct access to language and literacy. It is the lack of direct access to language 
that has been historically problematic for deaf individuals, contributing to English literacy achievement 
gaps that are evidenced in deaf education settings in the US (e.g., Qi & Mitchell, 2012). We are placing 
this study within a second language acquisition framework, following in the footsteps of deaf education 
researchers that recognize how deaf individuals’ challenges with English reading and writing share 
similar traits with other English language learners (Antia, Reed, & Kreimeyer, 2005; Berent, 2009; 
Berent, Kelly, & Schueler-Choukairi, 2009; 2012). This study explored the hypothesis that increased 
access to English via communication technologies would be related to stronger English literacy skills for 
deaf individuals. 
BACKGROUND 
Language and Communication Access 
Deaf individuals exhibit characteristics that are very similar to English language learners even if they use 
spoken English as a primary or secondary language. Deaf students’ gaps in English literacy achievement 
have been demonstrated across multiple contexts and data sources. Generally, the literature suggests that 
students who are deaf do not demonstrate English literacy skills comparable with their peers upon 
graduation from high school in the US (Paul, 2003; Qi & Mitchell, 2012; Schirmer & McGough, 2005).  
Despite challenges in obtaining accurate measures, most sources suggest that the average deaf high school 
graduate reads at the fourth grade level (e.g., Qi & Mitchell, 2012). Factors that contribute to successful 
mastery of English literacy for the deaf language learner are largely unknown (e.g. Luckner, Sebald, 
Cooney, Young, & Muir, 2005), but the lack of full access to English clearly plays a significant role in 
language and literacy development.  
The typically developing hearing child is fully immersed in the language of the environment from birth 
and on, ideal conditions for language acquisition. This is not the case for deaf children, of whom more 
than 90% are born to parents that do not have hearing losses and do not use sign language (Mitchell & 
Karchmer, 2011. Thus, for children with any level of hearing loss, exposure to language that is 
immediately and fully accessible is lacking. Even if deaf children receive direct linguistic access through 
sign language, whether in the home or at school, signed language development does not automatically 
transfer to language and literacy development in the spoken or written language of the environment (i.e., 
English). Sign and spoken languages have significant structural differences at the lexical and grammatical 
level (Krakow & Hanson, 1985). For deaf children who are able to access spoken language through 
auditory channels using residual hearing or auditory technologies such as cochlear implants or hearing 
aids, it is still questionable whether or not that access is equitable because gaps in comprehension still 
occur (Hyde, Punch, Power, Hartley, Neale, & Brennan, 2009) and the success rate with cochlear 
implants is highly variable (Peterson, Pisoni, & Miyamono, 2010). Even when a deaf child uses spoken 
English in school, language delays that are similar to English language learners are present (Antia, Reed, 
& Kreimeyer, 2005).

Language acquisition approaches that rely on audition are gambling upon the efficacy of those 
approaches, as the possibility exists that the deaf child will not benefit from those approaches and thus 
lose years of language acquisition opportunities and risk becoming linguistically deprived (Humphries et 
al., 2012). Technological interventions designed to provide auditory access to spoken languages are not 
benign; those interventions often restrict the use of sign language and thus runs the risk of perpetuating 
linguistic deprivation, which can confer severe long-term harms, both personal and social (Humphries et 
al., 2012). Instead of using technology to provide auditory access to the target spoken language, digital 
communication technologies can be used to provide equitable, direct access to the target language in 
another modality, that of text. These are technologies that deaf individuals are increasingly adopting and 
utilizing in their daily lives, thus the use of communication technologies aligns with personal preferences 
and life choices that deaf individuals demonstrate. 
Computer-Mediated Communication 
Communication technologies are often said to equalize the playing field, particularly for individuals and 
communities that have historically been marginalized. The Internet creates conditions where 
communication can increasingly occur across global and cultural boundaries. In 2000, only 41% of homes 
in the US had Internet access, while 72% had Internet connectivity in 2012 (NTIA, 2000; 2013). As 
penetration of technology increases, technology continues to evolve. For example, mobile phones, once 
only able to send and receive phone calls, are now utility devices that serve as handheld computers, 
navigational devices, music players, music and picture archives, still picture cameras, video cameras, 
mobile payment devices, video game platforms, and dating hubs. As technology evolves, prices drop, and 
the financial barrier to technological inclusion is lowered. In 1995, only 13% of the United States 
population owned a mobile phone, increasing to 38% in 2000, and 69% in 2005. In 2011, the number of 
wireless subscriptions in the U.S. population exceeded the U.S. population estimates for that year (CTIA, 
2013). Despite digital inequalities that still exist (Hargittai, 2002), smartphones and Internet access are 
now ubiquitous, bringing with them a new level of digital connectivity that reaches beyond lines of socio-
economic status, ethnicity, or disability status. Internet usage has increased steadily, yet differentiations 
across stratifications are still present.  
Communication technologies have largely been integrated in daily life for much of the global population 
that is connected to the Internet. While digital communications can involve multiple modalities, ranging 
from video, text, images, and voice, this study focuses on communication technologies that enable direct 
communication in a text modality, which we conceptualize as computer-mediated communication 
(CMC). Computer-mediated communication includes multiple ways of communicating online, including 
e-mailing, blogging, instant messaging, texting (SMS), and engaging in chat rooms, among others. The 
method of communicating online is dependent on the technological capacities available, restricted by 
technology or device limitations. In the last two decades, CMC has increasingly become more mobile as 
the penetration rates of mobile devices have showed steady gains (CTIA, 2013). However, the goals and 
uses of CMC have stayed constant: the desire to communicate directly with other individuals or 
communities through digital methods.  
Deaf Individuals and Computer-Mediated Communication  
Deaf individuals may be more likely to capitalize on technological advances that provide increased equity 
to communication access, as demonstrated by the literature exhibiting higher rates of computer-mediated 
communication usage by deaf individuals. Research on internet usage reveals that deaf individuals use the 
internet at higher rates than their peers in the general population for personal and group uses (Barak & 
Sandovsky, 2008), e-mailing, chatting (Valentine et al., 2006), and texting (Okuyama & Iwai, 2011). 
Among individuals with disabilities, deaf youths communicate by computer at a significantly higher 
percentage than their peers of other disability types (Newman et al., 2011). Communication technologies 
are clearly a significant part of life for deaf individuals, who use a variety of CMC tools on a daily basis, 
Carrie Lou Garberoglio, Duncan Dickson, Stephanie Cawthon, Mark Bond CMC & Deaf Individuals’ Literacy Skills 
 
Language Learning & Technology  121 
including SMS, e-mail, chat rooms, or instant messaging (Akamatsu, Mayer, & Farrelly, 2006; 
Garberoglio, 2013; Newman et al., 2011). Penetration rates of mobile phone ownership and SMS usage 
among the deaf are, not surprisingly, high; surveys of Australian and German deaf individuals reveal that 
94% to 96% of respondents had access to SMS messaging (Power, Power, & Horstmanshof, 2007a; 
Power, Power, & Rehling, 2007b). In a comparison of the cell phone usage patterns as they apply to 
contacting friends amongst Japanese high-school DHH students and their hearing peers, Okuyami & Iwai 
(2011) found that, compared to their hearing peers, a greater percentage of deaf students fell within the 
frequent text sender range.  
It has been proposed that lower English literacy levels that may be exhibited by deaf individuals serve as 
an impediment to the use of communication technologies (Okuyama & Iwai, 2011; Power et al., 2007a; 
2007b). However, studies of deaf students in developmental English programs, whether adolescents (Lissi 
& Schallert, 1999) or adult college students (Garberoglio, 2013) do not support this proposition. Lissi and 
Schallert (1999) reported: 
although they were reading under grade level, students had meaningful conversations in written 
English, addressing questions posed by the teacher, posing their own questions to the teacher or 
other students, reacting to other participants’ messages, sharing information, and generally having 
fun (p. 373).  
Deaf adults who were in developmental English classes, which can be thought of as an indicator of lesser 
English proficiency, overwhelmingly reported that CMC technologies were a large part of their daily 
lives, and generally felt confident about using English in informal communicative uses despite their 
weaknesses with English in more formal school-based settings (Garberoglio, 2013). Studies conducted in 
the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Israel, and the United States all reveal that CMC technologies 
are a significant part of daily life for deaf individuals, despite low literacy levels that are expected in those 
populations (Barak & Sandovsky, 2008; Garberoglio, 2013; Lomicky & Hogg, 2010; Power et al., 2007a; 
2007b; Valentine et al., 2006).  
The increasing use of computer-mediated communication has created an authentic context in which 
communication can take place using English in daily life for deaf individuals. As mobile phone 
penetration rates and CMC usage increases, exposure to the printed word will concurrently increase, and 
this exposure has been found to result in positive outcomes for the general population including not only 
reading skills but also other cognitive abilities (Stanovich, 1993). Increased access to communication also 
confers other benefits beyond the immediately apparent benefit of increased print exposure and direct 
access to text-based literacy. The ubiquitous use of text-based methods of communication is most often 
said to break down communication barriers, creating accessible spaces and leveling the playing field for 
deaf individuals (Barak & Sandovsky, 2008; Power et al., 2007a). In Japan, adolescents achieve a sense 
of tsungarikan, or closeness, via the constant connectivity with others provided by cell phone usage 
(Okuyama & Iwai, 2011).  Deaf individuals often reveal that the use of communication technologies 
enable increased independence (Pilling & Barrett, 2008), social access to both deaf and hearing 
individuals (Power et al., 2007b), social support, and information access (Shoham & Heber, 2012; 
Valentine et al., 2006). The Internet may create increased communication opportunities that confer not 
only practical or technical benefits but also psychological benefits, as indicated by a study revealing that 
deaf adolescents who were intensive Internet users were less lonely and had higher self-esteem than those 
who used the Internet less (Barak & Sadovsky, 2008).  
Computer-Mediated Communication and Language Development  
Computer-mediated communication has been used in formal language learning settings across multiple 
contexts for some time. Synchronous CMC, in particular, was first used in the 1980’s for language 
instruction at Gallaudet University, the world’s only liberal arts university for deaf students located in 
Carrie Lou Garberoglio, Duncan Dickson, Stephanie Cawthon, Mark Bond CMC & Deaf Individuals’ Literacy Skills 
 
Language Learning & Technology  122 
Washington, DC, where it was used as a tool to help deaf individuals communicate in English (Beauvois, 
1998). Despite the origins of synchronous CMC in deaf education, the research is sparse on CMC usage 
in deaf education settings and is far more robust in other foreign language learning settings. The most 
consistent finding in CMC research in second language learning settings is that CMC usage results in 
increased quantity and quality of language production (Beauvois, 1992, 1998; Chapelle, 1994; Chun, 
1994; Kelm, 1992; Kern, 1995; Warschauer, 1996). This increase in quantity and quality uses of the target 
language enabled by participation in synchronous CMC has been proposed to contribute to language 
outcomes that have emerged in specific areas such as reading, writing (Coniam & Wong, 2004; Sullivan 
& Pratt, 1996), greater syntactic and lexical complexity (Kern, 1995; Warschauer, 1996), and 
conversational skills including oral proficiency (Chun, 1994; Kern, 1995; Kitade, 2000; Payne & 
Whitney, 2002).  
Synchronous CMC exhibits characteristics similar to face-to-face conversations that are an important part 
of language acquisition. Accessing those face-to-face conversations is problematic for the deaf learner 
who is unable to engage in conversational interactions via spoken English, and thus synchronous CMC 
offers a feasible avenue for increasing interactional dialogue. In particular, the quantity and types of 
discourse functions used in synchronous discussions were found to be similar to the interactional 
modifications that are characteristic of face-to-face conversations and support language acquisition 
(Sotillo, 2000). From an interactionist perspective of language acquisition, the similarity of CMC to face-
to-face discussion is considered to be beneficial (Murray, 2000; Smith, 2003). Computer-mediated 
discussion can promote the type of specific interactional features in the negotiation of meaning that 
facilitates language development, according to second language acquisition theories (Blake, 2000; Kitade, 
2000; Lee, 2001; Pellettieri, 1999; Salaberry, 2000; Smith 2003). Current researchers posit that digital 
literacies may not be entirely characterized as comparable to written or spoken communication, but has 
characteristics of both spoken and written communication (Greenfield & Subrahmanyam, 2003; Jarvis, 
2005; Ling, 2005). The digital era may be reducing the traditional gap between “reading” and “writing” 
(Warschauer, Zheng, & Park, 2013), which supports the proposition that digital literacies can serve as a 
highly feasible way to engage in conversational negotiation of meaning via English text for deaf 
individuals. Communication technologies, particularly those that are increasingly used in the current age, 
such as SMS, allow for immediacy and informality in communication, sharing characteristics with spoken 
communication (Ling, 2005). Whatever the linguistic nature of CMC, it lowers the barriers to 
participation in communication and increases equitable and direct access to language via text modalities.  
Empirical research on the use of computer-mediated communication in deaf education is lacking, despite 
the origins of CMC in college instructional settings for deaf students (Beauvois, 1998). From the initial 
investigation of literature on CMC in deaf education settings, it appears that deaf students may engage 
more in conversational discourse, especially those who may be less inclined to engage in face-to-face 
discussion (Lissi & Schallert, 1999; Liu, Chou, Liu, & Yang, 2006). Deaf students also report their 
experiences with CMC to be positive (Schirmer & Ingram, 2003), especially in the “quality and quantity 
of their interactions” (Long, Vignare, Rappold, & Mallory, 2007, p.1; Long, Marchetti, & Fasse, 2011). 
Computer programs designed for language instruction showed tentatively promising learning outcomes 
for Bulgarian deaf language learners of English as a 2nd or 3rd language (Zamfirov & Saeva, 2013). 
Synchronous CMC appears to be a viable avenue for increased direct engagement with English for deaf 
students, as long as ideal conditions are met (Garberoglio, 2013). Deaf young adults indicate that using 
English in conversational interactions mediated via electronic text (SMS, chat, e-mails) facilitate 
immediate and situational language learning, particularly in an active “seeing” of how others use English 
(Garberoglio, 2013). In instructional settings for deaf students, the literature appears to indicate that CMC 
is a promising instructional tool, yet more research in that area is needed.  
It has yet to be investigated how the increased use of CMC in informal settings in daily life beyond school 
settings influences language use and language learning for deaf students. In the general population, there

are some findings of interest about the relationship between use of informal communication technologies 
and English literacy. In two studies of British children’s text messaging and literacy development, the use 
of textisms (common text-message abbreviations of words, such as LOL for laughing out loud or txt for 
text) was positively related to spelling attainment and other literacy skills (Wood, Jackson, Hart, Plester & 
Wilde, 2011; Wood, Meachem, Bowyer, Jackson, Tarzynski-Bowles, & Plester, 2011).  In another study, 
Plester, Wood, and Joshi (2009) found a strong relationship between reading ability and age of first phone 
ownership and suggested that early exposure to the printed word, occurring before the ages of 10–12, in 
the form of text messages may independently increase reading ability. Other research on the relationship 
between SMS usage and literacy has yielded mixed findings. Drouin and Davis (2009) found that 
amongst hearing college students who communicate via SMS, there were no significant differences in 
GPA or literacy rate (as measured by the Letter-word Identification and Reading Fluency tests of the WJ 
III Achievement test) between those who used textisms on a regular basis and those who did not. A recent 
study indicated that for young adults around the age of 20, grammatical violations while texting were 
associated with specific grammatical errors that also emerged when using spoken or written forms of 
language, but that association was an isolated one, and no association was found in younger age samples 
who were in primary and secondary school (Wood, Kemp, Waldron, & Hart, 2014). This could indicate 
that younger children who have texted for longer periods of time and integrated SMS usage in their daily 
lives are demonstrating distinctly different language uses when texting than when using conventional 
written or spoken language structures. Concerns in the general public that increases in textisms negatively 
influence literacy skills appear to be unfounded, and indeed, those textisms may even positively influence 
literacy. 
Research into the specific patterns of digital technology use reveals complex relationships between a 
variety of use factors and literacy outcomes. In a massive study of the relationship between attitudes and 
access to Information Communication Technology (ICT) and engagement in online reading activities and 
literacy, Lee and Wu (2012) analyzed data from 297,295 students from 42 countries and regions. They 
found that access to ICT at school failed to have a significant effect on either engagement in online 
reading activities or overall reading literacy, but that access to ICT at home was positively predictive of 
online reading activities. Interestingly, home access to ICT was found to be negatively predictive of 
reading literacy, but when engagement in online reading was analyzed as a mediator of home ICT access, 
the indirect effect of home ICT access on reading literacy was found to be positive and significant (Lee & 
Wu, 2012). It appears that the ways digital technologies are used affect the outcomes that may emerge, as 
indicated by studies that attend to specific types of technology usage. For example, students who used 
digital technology primarily for non-communicative purposes had lower literacy rates than those who 
used CMC technology primarily as a means of connecting to others (Grimley, Allan, & Solomon, 2010). 
Increasing use of communication technologies to connect to others, as measured by frequency, content, 
and varying types of language usage (i.e., textisms) may make a positive contribution to literacy 
outcomes. It has been suggested that those individuals with better literacy skills are able to use multiple 
registers of language usage, as a potential indicator of stronger metalinguistic skills (Coe & Oakhill, 
2011; Plester, Wood, & Joshi, 2009).  
This study is an exploratory analysis that examines the relationship between use of CMC and English 
literacy levels for deaf adolescents in the United States. To do an initial exploration of this relationship, a 
secondary analysis approach is appropriate. This approach allowed us to use information from a broad 
spectrum of deaf adolescents about their CMC practices, as this is a low-incidence population and thus 
large sample sizes are a challenge to obtain. The dataset used in this study, the second National 
Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS2), collected information about students with disabilities in the 
United States, with a total sample size of more than 11,000, of whom more than 1,000 were deaf or hard 
of hearing. As this is a longitudinal dataset, this analysis could assess how student frequency of CMC 
usage may be related to English literacy skills that were measured at a later time point.

METHODS 
Dataset 
The U.S. Office of Special Education Programs commissioned NLTS2 to create a nationally 
representative dataset for students with disabilities. Data was collected between 2001 and 2009, and this 
study used data from the first two waves, from 2001-2003. To be included, students had to be between 
thirteen and sixteen years of age on December 1, 2000. Students, their parents and guardians, and school 
staff responded to computer-assisted telephonic interviews, mail surveys, and direct assessments. This 
particular inquiry uses parent data on their adolescents’ CMC usage from the first wave to predict 
students’ English literacy skills, which were directly assessed in the second wave.  
Like many national datasets, NLTS2 used a sampling scheme that employed weighting and stratification. 
This was intended to make the dataset nationally representative, and to improve the efficiency of 
estimation. The efficiency of estimation and the representativeness are of particular concern for studies 
that attempt to predict outcomes from later waves of NLTS2. In later waves, attrition may limit 
generalizability and reduce the researcher’s power to detect a statistically significant difference. However, 
this particular inquiry only used data from the first two waves of NLTS2. As such, methods such as 
Taylor Linearization to account for weighting and stratification were deemed unnecessary. 
Variables 
Although the predictor variable and all the covariates were collected from the first wave of NLTS2, the 
dependent variable was collected in the second wave. 
Covariates in this analysis included demographic information, including gender, an indicator variable for 
Caucasian ethnicity, and a measurement of household income. Gender and ethnicity were taken from the 
cross-instrument dataset, which consisted of data that were collected and verified from multiple sources. 
No cross-instrument data reported on household income, so the parent survey in wave one provided that 
information.  
Parents rated from one to six “how often [the youth] interacts with others using e-mail/chatrooms”: the 
predictor variable consisted of this single question from the wave one parent survey.  For this study, these 
data were recoded so that higher scores indicated a greater use of computer-mediated communication than 
the lower scores. These data were collected through computer-assisted telephonic interviews.  
The dependent variable was a reading comprehension measure, which is an average of two different 
subtests on the Woodcock Johnson III Research Edition (see Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001, for 
details). We used the averages of the passage comprehension and synonym-antonym standard scores to 
obtain the reading comprehension score. The passage comprehension subtest assesses linguistic and 
cognitive skills, asking youth to notice and use textual information to respond to items that range in 
difficulty. The synonym-antonym subtest assesses vocabulary comprehension, asking youth to supply 
synonyms and antonyms to the words that are provided.  
Inclusion Criteria and Participants 
There were two inclusion criteria for this study. First, the student had to be deaf or hard of hearing; this 
data was based on parental response that their child was deaf, hard of hearing, or hearing impaired. This 
criterion allowed our study to include students across all levels of hearing loss. Secondly, listwise deletion 
was employed; in other words, students were deleted from the analysis if they were missing any data that 
were in the regression model. In particular, students had to have taken the direct assessment in the second 
wave, which likely excludes participants with more severe disabilities due to the assessment criteria, 
which required the evaluator to assess whether or not the student was able to participate independently in 
the academic assessment (Carter, Austin, & Trainor, 2012). Of the 1070 deaf students in wave one, 680 
students participated in the direct assessment. These numbers are rounded to the nearest tens value, in 
Carrie Lou Garberoglio, Duncan Dickson, Stephanie Cawthon, Mark Bond CMC & Deaf Individuals’ Literacy Skills 
 
Language Learning & Technology  125 
accordance with Institute of Education Science (IES) policy. Of these 680, about 170 parents did not 
provide adequate information for the analysis. The remaining sample consisted of 510 participants. 
Descriptive statistics for these participants are provided in the results section.  
Data analysis strategy 
Since there was only one dependent variable and only one predictor variable of interest, the data analysis 
was relatively straightforward. An ordinary least squares regression regressed the literacy score 
(described above), on household income, age, gender, a Caucasian indicator variable, and the degree to 
which the student participated in computer-mediated communication at home.  
Assumptions 
A possible concern in this analysis was that the assumption of independence was violated. This 
assumption, practically speaking, claims that the data are not clustered, or in other words, that students 
were sampled independently. For this analysis, many students came from the same local education agency 
(LEA). However, for most of the sample, there was not a great deal of clustering. Of the 199 LEAs 
included in the analysis, 180 of them had less than five deaf students in the study. On average, each LEA 
had 2.61 students, and the intra-class correlation was estimated at 0.161. A table of the actual type one 
error rate in this sort of situation suggests that the type one error has roughly doubled (Stevens, 2007, p. 
324). One could easily adopt a more stringent alpha level to compensate for this, by, say, adopting alpha 
= 0.01 instead. However, since the p-value of the independent variable’s coefficient would remain 
significant with this criterion, this concern would not result in inferential differences. Therefore, for the 
sake of parsimony, analysis continued as planned. Other than the independence assumption, all other 
assumptions seem to have been met. Residuals were normally distributed, with homogenous variance. 
RESULTS 
Descriptive statistics 
Recall that the requirements of this dataset require reporting participant numbers at the nearest tens value, 
so descriptive statistics may not equal 510. Of the 510 participants, 180 were male and 350 were 
Caucasian, 80 African-American, 70 Hispanic, and 20 Asian. Ages ranged from fourteen to eighteen at 
wave one; 220 participants were fourteen to fifteen years of age, 250 were sixteen to seventeen, and the 
remaining 50 were eighteen. There was a wide range of household incomes, with 100 parents reporting 
household incomes less than $20,000 a year, 170 reporting incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 a year, 
110 reporting incomes between $40,000 and $60,000, and 150 reporting incomes greater than $60,000. 
Parents reported household income within units of $5,000, but, for the sake of simplicity, they are 
reported within $20,000 here.  
Frequency statistics on the independent variable are provided in Table 1. Overall, there was good 
variability in the use of computer-mediated communication. The levels ranged from one to six, and the 
item had a mean value of 3.18, with a standard deviation of 1.74.   
Finally, the reading comprehension score, which consisted of the average of the synonym-antonym 
subtest and the passage comprehension subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson, was found to be roughly 
symmetric in distribution. The mean score was 76.52, and the standard deviation was 21.08 points.

As presented in Table 2, the use of CMC was significantly correlated with the literacy score to a moderate 
degree (r=0.320, t[510] = 7.72, p<0.001). The literacy score was also correlated to a small, but 
meaningful degree, with household income (r=0.201, t[510] = 4.65, p<0.001) and being Caucasian 
(r=0.206, t[510] = 4.83, p<0.001). Moreover, the use of CMC was significantly correlated, to a very small 
degree, with household income (r=0.145, t[510] = 3.32, p<0.001), the youth’s age (r=0.184, t[510] = 
4.236, p<0.001), and being Caucasian (r=0.244, t[510] = 0.244, p<0.001).  
Primary Analysis 
As previously discussed, the reading comprehension score was regressed on household income, age, 
gender, a Caucasian indicator variable, and the independent variable. Overall, use of CMC was related to 
a small to moderate increase in the literacy score. One standard-deviation increase in CMC use was 
related to a 0.287 standard-deviation increase in the reading comprehension measure (t[510] = 6.64, p < 
0.0001). This is considered a small to moderate relationship (Ferguson, 2009). Notably, although the 
Caucasian indicator variable and the household income variables were statistically significant, (t[510] = 
2.29, p<0.05 and t[510] = 2.86, p < 0.01, respectively), their effect sizes were not practically meaningful 
(β< 0.2 in both cases; see Ferguson, 2009). See Table 3 for further details.

DISCUSSION 
The results of this study indicate that frequency of CMC usage at home is positively related to English 
literacy skills for deaf individuals. Deaf adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 who e-mailed or 
engaged in chat rooms more frequently exhibited higher reading comprehension when those skills were 
assessed two years later. Frequency of CMC usage at time 1 had a small to moderate relationship with 
reading comprehension at time 2 (β = 0.3), explaining 8% of the variance in reading comprehension. This 
relationship is particularly significant, considering two primary issues: 1) the lack of evidence on what 
factors contribute to literacy skills for deaf individuals (Luckner et al., 2005), and 2) the difficulty in 
finding sufficiently large sample sizes with this low-incidence population that would garner likelihood of 
finding significance (Luckner, 2006). In addition, our analysis was extremely conservative due to the 
addition of multiple covariates, including gender, ethnicity, and family income. Previous research 
findings that revealed computer use at home to predict future academic achievement have revealed

Language Learning & Technology  128 
diminishing effects after socioeconomic status (SES) was accounted for (Bebell & Kay, 2010; 
Warschauer & Matchuniak, 2010). The significance of our findings that remain after controlling for 
family income supports the need to further investigate how CMC may contribute to English literacy skills 
for this population. 
We have presented our arguments and discussion from a perspective that increasing use of CMC 
interactions would result in improvements of English literacy skills for deaf individuals, but we recognize 
that causation cannot be determined from this analysis. The data available to us did not allow for any 
controls of preexisting literacy skills that would explain the longitudinal relationship between CMC usage 
at time 1 and English skills at time 2. It is highly likely that individuals with preexisting higher literacy 
skills may have higher likelihoods of engaging in CMC during adolescence. Yet, it stands that the 
literature shows deaf individuals to be highly likely to engage in CMC even if their literacy levels are low 
(e.g., Garberoglio, 2013; Lissi & Schallert, 1999). In addition, the sample in this study had an average 
reading comprehension score that was around two standard deviations below the norms for the general 
population. This point supports the possibility that CMC may support English language and literacy 
development for deaf individuals despite low English literacy levels. Nevertheless, the longitudinal nature 
of this dataset, the large sample size, and the small to moderate positive association all lend themselves 
towards a call for future research continuing to investigate this relationship. Future research can more 
fully assess the directionality of the relationship between CMC and English literacy for deaf individuals, 
particularly through exploring longer-term relationships than were available in the NLTS2 dataset, and 
accounting for preexisting English skills.  
Beyond a discussion of the directionality of the relationship between CMC and English skills, we suggest 
that these exploratory findings support language acquisition theories that posit increased interactions with 
the target language, conceptualized as continual modifications of input and output in an interactional 
relationship, to be important processes involved with reaching higher language proficiency (Long, 1996; 
Swain, 2006). Exposure to print alone, despite conferring positive results, is not sufficient to fully engage 
individuals in language learning (Swain, 1984). Active interaction with language is said to contribute to 
language and literacy development, and those interactions are made possible for deaf individuals through 
CMC. Engaging in online conversations through e-mailing, chatting, or texting also requires the user to 
develop capacities of communicating in differing registers, potentially contributing to stronger 
metalinguistic skills (Coe & Oakhill, 2011; Plester, Wood, & Joshi, 2009). For deaf individuals, CMC 
offers unparalleled opportunities to actively engage with English in multiple ways and registers that are 
not always available through auditory channels or static text found in reading or writing.  
At a minimum, our findings demonstrate that e-mailing and chatting online are positively associated with 
English literacy skills for deaf youths. This relationship aligns with other research work demonstrating 
positive relationships between texting and traditional English literacy skills (Plester, Wood, & Joshi, 
2009; Wood, et al., 2011a, 2011b), and answers Plester, Wood, and Joshi’s call for longitudinal research 
on this relationship. The results of this study build upon these previous researchers’ work, among others, 
and strengthen the argument against the popular media perspective that text literacy has a negative 
influence on English literacy (Thurlow, 2006). 
CONCLUSION 
The results from this study demonstrate that deaf adolescents who e-mailed and chatted online at higher 
frequencies also demonstrated higher reading comprehension skills in the years ahead. These findings 
indicate that a positive association exists between CMC and English literacy, and that CMC may be a 
promising avenue towards the development of English language proficiency for deaf individuals, upon 
further empirical investigation. Deaf individuals are a highly heterogeneous group, sometimes more so 
than the general population when considering the differing levels of auditory capabilities, language 
proficiencies, and preferred communication modalities that are found in this population (Easterbrooks, 
Carrie Lou Garberoglio, Duncan Dickson, Stephanie Cawthon, Mark Bond CMC & Deaf Individuals’ Literacy Skills 
 
Language Learning & Technology  129 
1999). Deaf individuals of varying backgrounds can all capitalize upon digital communication 
technologies, pointing towards the universal potentials of CMC as that which can be equitably accessed 
and utilized. Computer-mediated communication appears to be a highly effective tool in the deaf 
individual’s repertoire, with yet to be explored potentials of contributing to English language and literacy 
development.

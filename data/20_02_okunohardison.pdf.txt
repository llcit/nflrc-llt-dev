PERCEPTION-PRODUCTION LINK IN L2 JAPANESE VOWEL 
DURATION: TRAINING WITH TECHNOLOGY

This study examined factors affecting perception training of vowel duration in L2 
Japanese with transfer to production. In a pre-test, training, post-test design, 48 L1 English 
speakers were assigned to one of three groups: auditory-visual (AV) training using 
waveform displays, auditory-only (A-only), or no training. Within-group variables were 
vowel, preceding consonant, pitch pattern, and training talker’s voice. Perception pre- and 
post-tests measured identification accuracy and response time (RT). Training involved 
eight sessions with feedback, including waveforms for the AV group. Results indicated 
significant improvement for the AV and A-only groups with generalization to novel 
stimuli and a new voice as well as transfer to production; the AV group showed a greater 
rate of improvement. Participants found waveform displays very helpful. Vowel type, 
preceding consonant, and pitch pattern significantly affected perception in testing and 
training as did the training talker’s voice. The easiest pitch pattern was Low–High in the 
first syllable, perhaps reflecting English prosodic preference, and High–High in the 
second, which may be more salient. Perception was facilitated by talkers demonstrating 
greater pitch movement. Accuracy and RTs increased after training; participants reported 
spending more time evaluating post-training input. Results support the perception-
production link, and the role of variable talker- and context-dependent perceptual 
categories.

INTRODUCTION 
Studies involving the training of second language (L2) learners to improve their perception of nonnative 
sounds date back several decades. After years of mixed results, in the early 1990s, a series of auditory 
training studies reported significant improvement in the perceptual identification accuracy of American 
English (AE) /r/ and /l/ by learners whose first language (L1) was Japanese (e.g., Lively, Logan, & Pisoni, 
1993). These studies demonstrated a benefit to training with natural stimuli produced by multiple talkers, 
and generalization of improved performance to perception of novel stimuli and those produced by a new 
voice. Subsequent research found a transfer of the benefits of perception training to production 
improvement and retention of improved skills even in the absence of continued L2 input (e.g., Bradlow, 
Akahane-Yamada, Pisoni, & Tohkura, 1999). From these accomplishments, the following hallmarks of 
successful auditory perception training emerged: (a) multiple talkers producing sufficient exemplars in 
natural speech to represent the variability of the target sounds, (b) feedback during training, and (c) the 
use of an identification (vs. a discrimination) task. Other researchers then implemented this high 
variability paradigm to explore the contribution of visual speech cues from a talker’s face to learners’

identification accuracy (e.g., Hardison, 2003; Hirata & Kelly, 2010) and earlier word identification 
(Hardison, 2005b). From a theoretical perspective, the above findings suggested that L2 learners may rely 
on multimodal context- and talker-dependent exemplars as representations in memory to which input can 
be matched for identification (e.g., Hardison, 2003, 2012; Lively et al. 1993) in contrast to prototypical 
representations (i.e., phonemes) resulting from the abstraction of talker and contextual information from 
the speech signal. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Computer-based Visual Feedback for Training 
Visual cues have produced beneficial outcomes for learners of various target languages through the use of 
computerized displays. Displays offered by speech analysis software include fundamental frequency 
(pitch), spectrograms, and waveforms. The current study explored the efficacy of computer-based training 
to facilitate the acquisition of duration contrasts in L2 Japanese vowels. 
Several early reports advocated the use of pitch displays to improve learners’ intonation (e.g., de Bot, 
1983; Leather, 1990; Pennington & Esling, 1996). They are user-friendly and informative by making 
visually salient some of the challenging features in L2 speech (e.g., Chun, 1998; Chun, Hardison, & 
Pennington, 2008). In a study on the acquisition of L2 French prosody, learners (L1 AE) showed 
significant improvement in both prosody and segmental accuracy in sentence productions following 
training using real-time displays along with feedback from displays of native speaker (NS) productions of 
the same sentences (Hardison, 2004). Participants reported that they (a) became more aware of the pitch 
differences between native and learner speech because they could see them and (b) found visual feedback 
in training very helpful. 
Following the discussions by Chun (2002) and Levis and Pickering (2004) on the value of pitch displays 
at the discourse level of speech, Hardison (2005a) explored the training potential of visualizing pitch 
synchronized with the video of the oral presentations of advanced L2 speakers of English (L1 Chinese). 
Anvil (Kipp, 2001), a web-based video annotation tool, was used to integrate segments of the learners’ 
videorecorded oral presentations with the associated pitch tracking. Participants showed improvement 
over several weeks; the presence of synchronized video was particularly helpful with discourse-level 
input. An alternative type of intonation feedback was developed by Hincks and Edlund (2009) consisting 
of flashing lights to show learners how much pitch variation they had produced. This feedback 
significantly improved the pitch variation made by L1 Chinese learners of English in their oral 
presentations. 
Spectrograms were also helpful for lower-proficiency learners of L2 Spanish in raising awareness to the 
spectral differences (i.e., those related to the component frequencies that make up a sound) between stop 
consonants /b, d, g/ and their intervocalic realizations as approximants [β, ð, ɣ] in Spanish (Olson, 2014). 
Only brief tutorials on the use of Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2014) were required for the participants to 
make use of this tool. 
For durational contrasts, waveforms, requiring only minimal instruction, were used to compare auditory-
visual (AV) and auditory-only (A-only) web-based training for beginning-level learners of L2 Japanese 
(L1 AE) in the perception of geminate consonants (Motohashi-Saigo & Hardison, 2009). Geminates have 
a longer duration than their singleton counterparts. Segmental duration is a contrastive feature in Japanese 
and important for communication. Stimuli were singleton and geminate /t/, /k/, and /s/ followed by /a/ or 
/u/ (produced as a high back unrounded vowel with lip compression). Identification accuracy improved 
significantly, especially for the AV group who saw waveform displays as feedback during training. 
Production of geminates also improved significantly, especially for the AV group. In post-study 
interviews, learners commented that taking web-based training outside of regular classes was convenient 
and that they enjoyed the immediate feedback.

In terms of vowels, Wang and Munro (2004) used synthesized speech to train L2 English speakers (L1 
Chinese) to ignore duration, and focus on the vowel quality differences between the members of the pairs 
[i]-[ɪ], [u]-[ʊ], and [ɛ]-[æ]. Learners used a self-paced procedure and showed significant improvement on 
all three vowel contrasts after two months of training, and retained performance levels 3 months later. 
Using the software program Sona-Match (KayPentax), Carey (2004) found that Korean speakers were 
able to improve their production of the vowel [æ] in citation form, but not in continuous speech. Sona-
Match uses the first and second formant frequencies of a speaker’s vowel production to plot it in a vowel 
space on the computer screen. 
Finally, with reference to vowel length contrasts in Japanese, the focus of the current study, Hirata and 
Kelly (2010) found that L1 English speakers with no prior exposure to Japanese showed greater 
improvement in identifying vowel duration after four sessions of perception training if they were able to 
see the speaker’s mouth on the computer screen. 
Phonological Features of Japanese Vowels 
One of the challenges in acquiring durational contrasts in L2 Japanese is the role of the mora, which is a 
unit of timing in the language that is important in both perception and production (e.g., Kubozono, 1999). 
Special morae include the second half of a long vowel; for example, kiite “listening” has three morae /ki-
i-te/ which form two syllables /kii.te/. In addition, Japanese has a pitch-accent system. As the current 
study concerns Tokyo Japanese, we focus on that dialect’s patterns in which accent is realized as a high 
(H) pitch followed by a low (L) pitch (Haraguchi, 1999). The location of the accent corresponds to the 
mora before the pitch drop. In the case of a long vowel, the first mora carries the H pitch so that an HL 
pitch contour occurs within the long vowel. 
Thus, accented long vowels have two phonologically distinctive features—duration and pitch-accent—
which can differentiate meaning between words. Figure 1 shows the pitch patterns selected for this study. 
They occur in kyootsuu-go, the common variety of Japanese widely used in the Tokyo dialect (Shibatani, 
1990). The examples are labeled according to syllable structure type and pitch pattern within these 
categories: unaccented, initial-, second-, and third-mora accented (Haraguchi, 1999). 
L2 learners of Japanese appear to be sensitive to pitch pattern differences. Minagawa (1997) investigated 
whether the patterns HH, LL, HL, and LH affected perception of vowel duration for learners whose L1s 
were Korean, Chinese, English, Spanish, and Thai. Results indicated (a) greater perception accuracy of 
long vowels with the HH pattern and (b) a tendency to perceive a long vowel as a short vowel when the 
word had a LL pattern. Koguma (2000) found that long vowels in word-final position appeared to be 
more difficult for learners to perceive accurately compared to those in word-initial position. 
In the current study, we investigated the effects of both pitch pattern and syllable location of the vowel 
(i.e., in the first or second syllable) in a word on response accuracy and latency in the perception of vowel 
duration in L2 Japanese by L1 AE speakers. A pre- and post-test design with controls was used to address 
the following research questions: (a) What are the effects of training with and without waveform displays 
on the perception accuracy and response latency of vowel duration by L2 learners of Japanese? (b) Does 
pitch pattern and syllable location of the long vowel affect perception? (c) Are there talker effects in 
perception accuracy and latency? (d) Does perception training transfer to production improvement in the 
absence of explicit instruction? (e) Does training generalize to perception of novel stimuli and those 
produced by a new talker’s voice? Based on previous research (e.g., Motohashi-Saigo & Hardison, 2009), 
we hypothesized that training overall would be successful but that variability would also be found in 
response to talker and stimulus variables such as pitch pattern and syllable location of the vowel.

METHOD 
Participants 
A total of 64 learners of Japanese as a foreign language (aged 18–22; 36 female, 28 male; L1 AE) 
volunteered to participate in this study at a large Midwestern university in the US. There were no heritage 
speakers of Japanese or students who had studied abroad in Japan. All reported normal hearing and vision. 
They were enrolled in Japanese courses as follows: first year of study (n = 24), second year (n = 17), third 
year (n = 16), and fourth year (n = 7). The course instructors corrected inaccurate pronunciation during 
oral drills and communicative activities, but did not focus on segmental duration or pitch-accent. 
Materials 
Production Testing 
Materials for production testing included 4 practice tokens (e.g., noono) and 16 bisyllabic tokens 
contrasting long and short vowels in a range of syllable structure types (see Appendix A). The consonants 
/k/ and /s/ were combined with vowels /a/ and /u/ to construct pseudowords to avoid the effects of word 
frequency and learner knowledge (e.g., Bundgaard-Nielsen, Best, & Tyler, 2011). The stop and fricative 
were selected based on the findings of Hardison and Motohashi-Saigo (2010), suggesting a role in learner 
perception for consonant-vowel sonority differences1. The vowels /a/ and /u/ represent the longest and 
shortest vowels respectively in the Tokyo dialect (Yoshida, 2006). The choice of materials was guided by 
Tomoko Okuno and Debra M. Hardison L2 Japanese Vowel Training 
 
Language Learning & Technology 65 
classroom observations of learner difficulty and the results of pilot testing with a peer group (N = 40), 
which indicated that tokens with a long vowel in the first syllable (CVV.CV) or in both syllables 
(CVV.CVV) were produced more accurately than those with a long vowel in the second syllable 
(CV.CVV) or a short vowel in each syllable (CV.CV). 
Perception Testing and Training 
Perception materials included two sets of four practice stimuli each (one set for testing; one for training); 
neither involved the consonants (/k/ and /s/) or vowels (/a/ and /u/) under test. Selection of syllable types 
and pitch patterns for perception testing (Appendix B) and training (Appendix C) was guided by the 
results of the aforementioned peer group pilot testing with a large number of tokens from all patterns in 
Figure 1. Findings revealed that learners had more difficulty identifying vowel duration in the second 
syllable, especially with an HL or LL (vs. HH) pattern. In the current study, most items were 
pseudowords; five in the training set were real words but occurred infrequently in the participants’ 
instructional input. 
Testing stimuli were produced by a female NS of Japanese from Tokyo and digitally recorded. Training 
stimuli were produced by four NSs of Japanese (2 female, 2 male) from Tokyo. With the goal of 
providing natural speech, the vowel /u/ was allowed to devoice as this can occur in the Tokyo dialect 
when it follows a voiceless consonant and either precedes a voiceless consonant or occurs in word-final 
position, unless the vowel is in a position to receive an accent (Tsujimura, 2007). Speech rate was 
consistent throughout the recordings. There was no significant difference in duration between accented 
and unaccented vowels (e.g., for long /a/, U = 9.00, p = .412). All stimuli were accurately identified by 
NSs prior to their use. 
For the AV training condition, waveforms generated in Praat served as visual input. Examples from the 
study are shown in Figure 2. The vertical lines drawn on each side of /k/ represent the closure period for 
the stop. The examples in the top row have a long vowel (i.e., kaaka and suusu); those in the bottom row 
have a short vowel (i.e., kaka and susu).

Tests of Generalization 
Tests of generalization (TGs) investigated the generalizability of training to the perception of unfamiliar 
stimuli produced by a familiar female voice from training (TG1), and familiar stimuli produced by an 
unfamiliar female voice (TG2). The unfamiliar stimuli for TG1 involved the consonant /t/ and vowel /e/ 
(see Appendix D), which had not been used in the pre-test, post-test, or training.

Procedure 
Production Testing 
A computer-based production test was created using E-Prime and administered to participants 
individually in a quiet room prior to the perception test to avoid exposing them to auditory input 
involving the target tokens. Practice tokens familiarized the participants with the task. All were written in 
roomaji (the Roman alphabet representation of Japanese sounds) versus hiragana. Classroom experience 
with similar learners indicated that roomaji made the vowel duration distinction clearer. Participants first 
read these instructions on the screen: “After a plus sign (+), a word will appear on the computer screen. 
When you are ready to say the word, press ‘p’ and say it.” The plus sign appeared for 2 s. After the 
participant pressed the p key, the screen was cleared. Productions were digitally recorded and saved. 
Perception Testing 
After the production test, a forced-choice, four-alternative perceptual identification task was administered. 
Four practice stimuli familiarized participants with the task. The 18 testing stimuli were then presented. 
As with the production test, participants were alerted with a plus sign in the middle of the screen for 2 s, 
and instructed as follows: “You will hear a word. Please choose what you think you just heard from the 
list of words by pressing 1, 2, 3, or 4. Please choose as quickly and accurately as possible.” While 
listening, participants were able to see the response options (similar to Figure 3, but without the 
waveform). Each stimulus was heard once. When it ended, the timer to measure the response time (RT) 
started. When a response was made, the timer stopped. The screen then showed the plus sign again and 
moved to the next trial. There was no feedback during testing. For each stimulus, a participant’s 
identification accuracy and RT were recorded by the computer and saved. 
Perception Training 
Participants were divided into two groups: one received AV training where the visual input was a 
waveform display, and the other received A-only training. Between the pre-test and post-test, participants 
in both groups took 8 perception training sessions individually (approximately 25 min each, 4 days per 
week for 2 weeks). A forced-choice four-alternative identification task was used similar to the testing 
format. Before the first session, the AV training group received instruction for about 5 min, including a 
demonstration of how long and short vowels appeared in waveforms while they listened to audio files 
unrelated to the study. Participants in the AV training group listened to the stimulus and chose what they 
heard from the list of options while watching the associated waveform (see Figure 3, kaaka).

Participants in the A-only group did not see the waveform; otherwise, the procedure was the same. After 
participants in both groups made their selection, the correct item (and waveform for the AV group)

appeared on the screen and the audio was replayed. Identification accuracy and RTs were saved for 
analysis. 
Tests of Generalization 
TGs were administered to both training groups after the post-test. Stimulus presentation followed the 
same format and procedure as for the pre-test and post-test. Both perception accuracy and RT were 
recorded for comparison with the post-test data to see if improvement from training had generalized to 
novel stimuli and a new voice. At the conclusion of all testing, the first author interviewed each 
participant about their perceptions of the efficacy of the training. 
RESULTS 
It was determined a priori that participants whose scores were 90% or higher in the perception pre-test 
would be excluded from training. From the initial 64 participants, 12 were excluded due to this criterion. 
These 12 were comprised of three participants from each of the four years of Japanese study, including a 
first-year student who scored 100%. Of the 52 remaining participants, four did not complete all tasks; 
therefore, their data were not analyzed. For the final 48 participants, there was no correlation between 
pre-test identification accuracy and year of study; therefore, their data were combined for analysis. 
Results are presented in the following order: (a) comparability of groups in pre-test perception accuracy 
and latency, (b) effects of training and stimulus variables on accuracy, (c) effects of training and stimulus 
variables on response latency, (d) analysis of training effects per group, (e) effects of perception training 
on production, and (f) TGs. For statistical analysis, the alpha level was set at .05. Data met the 
assumptions of all tests. 
Perception 
Comparability of Groups at Pre-test 
The participants were divided into three groups: AV training group (n = 16), A-only training group 
 (n = 16), and control (i.e., no training) group (n = 16). Each group included a similar range of pre-test 
perceptual identification accuracy scores. Both response accuracy and RT data were analyzed. In terms of 
accuracy, the participants’ choice was coded as either correct (one point) or incorrect (zero). When a 
choice was not made, no point was given. RT was measured in ms using E-Prime. Two one-way 
ANOVAs confirmed the comparability of the groups at pre-test in identification accuracy, 
F(2, 47) = 0.424, p = .657 and RT, F(2, 47) = 0.076, p = .927. 
Effects of Training and Stimulus Variables on Accuracy 
The descriptive statistics for perception accuracy in the pre-test and post-test for each group (AV, A-only, 
control) are shown in Table 1. Both training groups increased in mean accuracy and the standard 
deviations decreased, especially for the AV group. 
Table 1. Descriptive Statistics for Perception Accuracy in the Pre-test and Post-test

A-only 16 .71 (.15) .88 (.13) 
Control 16 .66 (.17) .64 (.20) 
An ANOVA was conducted to determine if the training had been effective in improving identification 
accuracy of vowel duration. The within-group factor was time (2); the between-groups factor was group 
type (3). Results indicated a significant effect of time for perception accuracy, F(1, 45) = 68.275, p < .001,

ηp
2 = .6032, and group, F(2, 45) = 6.956, p = .002, ηp2 = .236. The Time × Group interaction was also 
significant, F(2, 45) = 25.271, p < .001, ηp2 = .529. Tukey’s HSD tests indicated that the control group 
was significantly different from the AV group (p = .003) and the A-only group (p = .018). There was no 
significant difference between the two training groups (p = .788) although overall accuracy increased 
more for the AV group and at a faster rate as shown in Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4. Mean percent accuracy for perception at pre-test and post-test by group. 
We also examined how stimulus variables affected identification accuracy of vowel duration and how this 
changed from pre-test to post-test as a result of training. Earlier pilot testing suggested that the location of 
the long vowel in the second (vs. first) syllable was particularly problematic for learners. This finding was 
used in the present study to place the syllable structure types and pitch patterns into three categories to 
facilitate analysis. With reference to Figure 1, pitch patterns (1) LH.HH, (2) HL.LL, and (3) LH.HL 
formed Group I containing two long vowels (CVV.CVV); patterns (4) LH.H and (5) HL.L formed Group 
II with one long vowel in the first syllable (CVV.CV); and patterns (6) L.HH, (7) H.LL, and (8) L.HL 
formed Group III with one long vowel in the second syllable (CV.CVV). The pattern CV.CV was not 
included in testing but was used in training for contrastive purposes. 
An ANOVA revealed a significant effect of pattern group, F(2, 126) = 10.866, p < .001, ηp2 = .147. Data 
were further analyzed within each of the three pattern groups. Within-group factors were time (2), 
preceding consonant (2), vowel (2), and pattern type (for Group I, 3 patterns; Group II, 2 patterns; Group 
III, 3 patterns); the between-groups factor was training type (2). Discussion focuses on the significant 
findings. 
For Group I (CVV.CVV), there was a significant effect of time, F(1, 30) = 44.885, p < .001, ηp2 = .599, 
but not training type, F(1, 30) = .839, p = .367. Overall mean percent accuracy at pre-test was .62 
(SD = .15) which increased to .91 (SD = .06) at post-test. There was a significant effect of pattern type, 
F (2, 126) = 10.866, p < .001, ηp2 = .147. Pairwise comparisons indicated that LH.HH showed 
significantly greater accuracy compared to LH.HL (p < .001) and HL.LL (p < .001). LH.HH and LH.HL 
share the same pitch pattern on the first syllable but differ in the second syllable (HH and HL 
respectively), suggesting that this difference may have played a role. 
For Group II (CVV.CV), results indicated significant effects of time, F(1, 30) = 10.083, p = .003, 
ηp
2 = .252; preceding consonant, F(1, 63) = 7.471, p = .008, ηp2 = .106; pattern type, F(1, 63) = 28.474, 
p < .001, ηp2 = .311; and vowel, F(1, 63) = 10.938, p = .002, ηp2 = .148. There was also a significant 
effect of training type, F(1, 30) = 6.127, p = .019, ηp2 = .170 with the AV group increasing in mean

percent accuracy from .78 (SD = .16) to .97 (SD = .05); the A-only group increased from .73 (SD = .19) 
to .78 (SD = .10). It was easier for learners to identify vowel duration when (a) the vowel was /a/ versus 
/u/, (b) the preceding consonant was /k/ versus /s/, and (c) when the pitch pattern was LH.H versus HL.L. 
For Group III (CV.CVV), results indicated significant effects of time, F(1, 30) = 24.083, p < .001, 
ηp
2 = .445; vowel, F(1, 63) = 5.154, p = .027, ηp2 = .076; and pattern type, F(2, 126) = 5.586, p = .005, 
ηp
2 = .081. Training type was not significant. Overall mean accuracy increased from .73 (SD = .17) to .91 
(SD = .05) and was higher when (a) the vowel was /a/ versus /u/ and (b) when the pitch pattern was L.HH 
versus H.LL (p < .01). These two patterns are very distinct; L.HH starts with low pitch and remains high 
after the second mora; H.LL is the opposite. 
Effects of Training and Stimulus Variables on Response Latency 
The descriptive statistics for the RT data from the perception pre-test and post-test are shown in Table 2.

RTs for the training groups significantly increased over time, F(1, 45) = 10.748, p = .002, ηp2 = .193; even 
the control group’s responses were slower. We address this issue later in the discussion.

Figure 5. Mean response latency for perception at pre-test and post-test by group. 
Further analysis focuses on the significant differences from ANOVAs for RTs within the pitch pattern 
groups shown in Figure 1. For each of the three groups, the within-group factors were time (2), consonant 
(2), vowel (2), and pattern type (Group I, 3 patterns; Group II, 2 patterns; Group III, 3 patterns); the 
between-groups factor was group type (AV, A-only, control). 
For Group I (CVV.CVV), results revealed no significant main effects or interactions; however, there was 
a significant effect of time for Group II (CVV.CV), F(1, 30) = 7.593, p = .010, ηp2 = .202, and Group III

(CV.CVV), F(1, 30) = 16.515, p < .001, ηp2 = .355. For these two pattern groups, each having one long 
vowel, learners took more time to respond. 
Analysis of Training Effects 
To examine the effects of talker and stimulus factors during training, perception accuracy and RT data 
from the training sessions were analyzed per group. Results for accuracy are presented first followed by 
those for RTs. Figure 6 shows the mean perception accuracy for stimuli produced by each training talker. 
Generally, higher scores were found for the AV training group, which had access to waveforms as 
feedback during training. 
 
Figure 6. Perception accuracy by talker in training. 
Accuracy of AV Training Group 
A three-way ANOVA investigated the effects of training week (2), talker (4), and pattern type within each 
syllable structure group. For Group I (CVV.CVV), there was a marginally significant effect of week, F(1, 
15) = 4.444, p = .052, with scores increasing in the second week. For Group II (CVV.CV), there was a 
significant effect of talker, F(3, 45) = 19.056, p < .001, ηp2 = .560. Pairwise comparisons revealed that 
accuracy for stimuli produced by Talker 4 was significantly lower compared to the other talkers. Mean 
percent accuracy varied as follows: .63 (Talker 4), .82 (Talker 3), .89 (Talker 5), and .93 (Talker 2). 
While the precise source of the lower accuracy for Talker 4 is not known, a possible explanation appears 
in Figure 7, which shows the waveform and pitch track for kaakaa (HL.LL) produced by each training 
talker. Across talkers, these long vowels were of comparable duration; however, note that Talkers 2, 3, 
and 5 showed greater pitch movement (indicated by the blue line), especially in the initial-accented mora 
compared to Talker 4. Although all auditory stimuli were accurately identified by NSs prior to the study, 
the variability in the acoustic characteristics of voices as shown in this example may have influenced 
learner perception. 
For Group III (CV.CVV), there was a significant effect of talker, F(3, 45) = 4.470, p = .008, ηp2 = .230. 
Pairwise comparisons indicated that learners were more accurate in their perception of the duration of 
vowels produced by Talker 5 compared to the others although mean accuracy for stimuli in this group 
was relatively high, ranging from .89 (Talker 2) to .96 (Talker 5).

Finally, for Group IV (CV.CV), there was a significant effect of week, F(1, 15) = 6.363, p = .023, 
ηp
2 = .298, with higher accuracy in the second week. Mean percent accuracy for all talkers was above .90. 
Accuracy of A-only Training Group 
A three-way ANOVA investigated the effects of training week (2), talker (4), and pattern type within each 
syllable structure group. For Group I (CVV.CVV), there was a significant effect of week, F(1, 15) = 
6.310, p = .024, ηp2 = .296, with mean accuracy rising from .83 to .88 by the end of the second week. 
There was substantial variability within the data as evidenced by a significant Week × Talker interaction, 
F(3, 45) = 1.815, p = .049, ηp2 = .108. Simple effects tests pointed to lower accuracy again for Talker 4 in 
the first week of training. 
For Group II (CVV.CV), there was a significant effect of talker, F(3, 45) = 15.527, p < .001, ηp2 = .509, 
with stimuli produced by Talker 4 also showing a significantly lower percent accuracy (.58) compared to 
the other talkers for whom accuracy ranged from .84 to .91. There was a significantly lower accuracy for 
saa.aa (HL.L) at .65 compared to the other stimuli (accuracy of .84 to .86). For Group III (CV.CVV), 
there was a significant Talker × Pattern Type interaction, F(3, 45) = 2.792, p = .002, ηp2 = .157. Simple 
effects tests revealed lower accuracy for sa.saa (L.HL) produced by Talker 4. For Group IV (CV.CV), 
there was a significant Talker × Pattern Type interaction, F(3, 45) = 5.293, p = .003, ηp2 = .261; again,

vowel identification accuracy for stimuli with a H.L pattern (e.g., ka.ka, sa.sa, ku.ku) was lower when 
produced by Talker 4. 
Response Latency of AV Training Group 
Figure 8 shows the mean RTs for stimuli produced by the four training talkers. The AV (vs. A-only) 
group showed shorter RTs to stimuli produced by all the talkers. The RT data were analyzed the same 
way as the accuracy data. Discussion focuses on the significant findings. For Groups I (CVV.CVV) and II 
(CVV.CV), mean RTs were significantly shorter from Week 1 to Week 2, (e.g., FGroup I(1, 15) = 19.363, 
p = .001, ηp2 = .563). For Group III (CV.CVV), there were significant effects of week, F(1, 15) = 5.525, 
p = .033, ηp2 = .269, and talker, F(3, 45) = 6.417, p = .001, ηp2 = .300. Mean RTs were shorter in the 
second week and longer for Talkers 3 and 5. For Group IV (CV.CV), there was a significant Week × 
Talker interaction, F(3, 45) = 6.672, p = .001, ηp2 = .308. Simple effects tests found that learners’ RTs 
significantly decreased for stimuli produced by Talker 2 from Week 1 to Week 2.

Response Latency of A-only Training Group 
A three-way ANOVA was carried out on the RTs from the training data for the A-only group. For Group 
I (CVV.CVV), there was a significant effect of week, F(1, 15) = 8.683, p = .010, ηp2 = .367, and a 
significant Week × Talker interaction, F(3, 45) = 4.312, p = .011, ηp2 = .216. RTs to stimuli produced by 
Talker 2 were shorter in the second week. For Group II, there was a significant effect of talker,  
F(3, 45) = 3.410, p = .025, ηp2 = .185. RTs to tokens produced by Talker 5 were shorter than those 
produced by Talker 3. For Group III (CV.CVV), there was also an effect of talker, F(3, 45) = 7.610, 
p < .001, ηp2 = .337; RTs were shorter for Talker 5. Learners demonstrated shorter RTs to stimuli with the 
pattern L.HH versus L.HL or H.LL, especially if they involved /ku/ versus /sa/. Finally, for Group IV 
(CV.CV), there were significant effects of week and talker, and a significant Week × Talker interaction, 
F(3, 45) = 12.816, p < .001, ηp2 = .461, with RTs decreasing in Week 2 for tokens produced by Talker 2. 
Effects of Perception Training on Production 
To examine whether perception training transferred to another skill, mean pre-test and post-test 
production accuracy ratings were provided by three raters from the Tokyo area who had a background in 
linguistics and experience teaching Japanese. They were instructed to consider only vowel duration in 
their evaluations. Raters selected what they heard from a list of options which varied according to the 
duration and syllable location of the vowels. Based on pilot testing, options included a geminate 
Tomoko Okuno and Debra M. Hardison L2 Japanese Vowel Training 
 
Language Learning & Technology 73 
consonant (e.g., kakka). For example, for the item kaakaa, the options were (a) kaakaa, (b) kaaka, (c) 
kakka, (d) kaka, and (e) other. Raters who chose (e) other were asked to write what they heard. One point 
was given for each correct pronunciation. Inter-rater reliability revealed a significant positive correlation 
between Raters 1 and 2 (r = .914, p < .001, R2 = .84), Raters 1 and 3 (r = .930, p < .001, R2 = .86) and 
Raters 2 and 3 (r = .906, p < .001, R2 = .82). For all items, there was absolute agreement from at least two 
raters. Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics for each training group in the pre- and post-test.

Group n Mean Percent Accuracy (SD) 
Pre-test Post-test 
AV 16 .66 (.20) .91 (.08) 
A-only 16 .69 (.14) .90 (.09) 
The mean raters’ scores were analyzed using ANOVA. Within-group factors were time (2), vowel (2), 
preceding consonant (2), and token type (4); the between-groups factor was training type (2). Results 
indicated a significant effect of time, F(1, 30) = 67.148, p < .001, ηp2 = .691, and token type, 
F(3, 90) = 5.392, p = .002, ηp2 = .152; however, vowel, F(1, 30) = 1.815, p = .188; training group, 
F(1, 30) = 1.600, p = .216; and preceding consonant, F(1, 30) = .062, p = .806 were not significant. 
Pairwise comparisons indicated that production of the token with only one long vowel in the first syllable 
(CVV.CV) was the most accurate. 
In addition to the main effect of token type, the Time × Token Type interaction was significant,  
F(3, 90) = 7.977, p < .001, ηp2 = .210. Results of simple effects tests revealed that production of CVV.CV 
was better than the other syllable types at pre-test (mean of .85) and improved to .97. CV.CVV and 
CV.CV showed comparable improvement (from a mean of .56 to .92, and .62 to .94, respectively); and 
CVV.CVV improved slightly (from .74 to .75). The Vowel × Token Type interaction, F(3, 90) = 2.929, 
p = .038, ηp2 = .089 was also significant; production accuracy of CVV.CVV tokens was higher when the 
vowel was /a/. 
In summary, production accuracy improved from pre-test to post-test with no significant difference 
between the two training groups. Three token types (CVV.CV, CV.CVV, and CV.CV) significantly 
improved after training, but not the CVV.CVV (two long vowels) although its accuracy was greater with 
the vowel /a/ versus /u/. In general, since the learners had received no specific production training or 
practice, results suggested that focused perception training had shown some transfer to improved 
production. 
Tests of Generalization 
Perception Accuracy 
Analyses were performed to determine if training would generalize to the perception of unfamiliar stimuli 
spoken by a familiar talker (TG1; Appendix D), and familiar stimuli (i.e., used in testing) spoken by an 
unfamiliar talker (TG2). Descriptive statistics for perception accuracy in the TGs and post-test are shown 
in Table 4. An ANOVA was conducted with test (post-test, TG1) as the within-group variable and 
training type (2) as the between-groups variable. Results indicated no significant effect of test,  
F(1, 30) = .438, p = .513. The effect of training group, F(1, 30) = 3.586, p = .068, and the Test × Training 
Group interaction, F(1, 30) = 3.800, p = .061 approached significance. 
To examine whether the post-test and TG2 (unfamiliar talker) were comparable, an ANOVA was 
conducted with test (post-test, TG2) as the within-group variable and training group type (2) as the 
between-groups variable. Results indicated no significant effect of test, F(1, 30) = .786, p = .382. 
Training group type approached significance, F(1, 30) = 3.890, p = .058; the AV group had higher scores.

The Test × Training Group interaction approached significance, F(1, 30) = 3.610, p = .067. Thus, the 
effects of the training showed some generalization to novel stimuli and a new talker’s voice.

Table 5 shows descriptive statistics for the RT data. Separate ANOVAs were performed to compare the 
perception RT data from the post-test with those from TG1 and TG2. The within-group variable was test 
(2) and between-groups variable was training type (2). For TG1, results indicated a significant effect of 
test, F(1, 30) = 92.711, p < .001, ηp2 = .756; RTs in TG1 were shorter. However, neither training type,  
F(1, 30) = .796, p = .379, nor the Test × Training Group interaction was significant, F(1, 30) = 1.873, 
p = .181. For TG2, results indicated significant effects of test, F(1, 30) = 28.422, p < .001, ηp2 = .486; 
RTs in TG2 were shorter. However, neither training type, F(1, 30) = 1.038, p = .316 nor the Test × 
Training Type interaction, F(1, 30) = .941, p = .340 was significant. In summary, learners generally 
demonstrated shorter RTs in TGs versus the post-test; however, there were no significant differences 
between the two training groups.

GENERAL DISCUSSION 
This study investigated the factors affecting the perception and production of vowel duration in L2 
Japanese, and the effectiveness of waveform displays in training. Results demonstrated that perception 
training significantly improved overall accuracy in the identification of vowel duration. Although the AV 
group showed greater improvement at a faster rate, its performance was not significantly different from 
the A-only group. Greater accuracy was accompanied by longer RTs. Participants’ comments following 
the current study suggest reasons for this finding. Those who received training, especially in the AV 
group, which saw waveforms, were faced with more information on which to base their post-test 
responses. Many commented that they were more confident in their post-test accuracy, which was 
supported by the data, but it came at a processing cost. It is possible we are seeing what transpires in the 
earlier stages of focused training. Consequently, if the training period had been longer, the RTs might 
have become shorter. The control group members indicated they were trying to do better in the post-test 
despite the lack of training, having felt less confident about their pre-test accuracy. Consequently, they 
took more time to respond hoping it would result in better accuracy, which was not the case. The training 
groups’ RTs were also shorter in the TGs compared to the post-test. Participants in the training groups 
said that by the time they reached the end of the study, the tasks (i.e., the TGs) seemed easier, and they 
were feeling more confident.  
Similar to previous training studies, results indicated a significant influence of preceding consonant, 
vowel type, and talker’s voice in training. As hypothesized in the current study, there were also 
significant effects according to pitch pattern and syllable location of the long vowel or vowels. Prior to 
Tomoko Okuno and Debra M. Hardison L2 Japanese Vowel Training 
 
Language Learning & Technology 75 
training, learners exhibited more accurate perception for stimuli that had the pattern LH.H where there is 
only one long vowel in the first syllable, and the pitch remains high after it rises. The next best 
performance was for words with a L.HH pattern where the long vowel is in the second syllable with a 
consistently high pitch. These findings are compatible with English-based prosodic preferences for a 
rising intonation, and the salience created by a high pitch. In the post-test, there was generally less 
variability in accuracy across stimulus types although the best performance still tended to be for LH.HH 
followed by L.HH. 
Consistent with other studies (e.g., Bradlow et al., 1999; Hardison, 2003), talker variability influenced 
perception, and perception training transferred to significant production improvement. The precise nature 
of the perception-production link is not known, and it is clear that not every learner follows the same path 
nor that these skills enjoy parallel development. However, this transfer to production improvement has 
been a consistent finding in studies whether the target sounds were AE /r/ and /l/ (e.g., Bradlow et al., 
1999; Hardison, 2003), Japanese geminates (Motohashi-Saigo & Hardison, 2009), or vowels as in the 
current study. 
Generalization of improvement to novel stimuli and a new voice is a valuable goal that takes skill 
improvement to new contexts. However, the findings should be interpreted with some caution as 
generalization was tested in this and other studies with a finite stimulus set and one new voice. There are 
some additional limitations in this study. The choice of stimuli for perception testing and training was 
based on the challenging syllable types and pitch patterns suggested by teaching experience and the 
results of pilot testing. This permitted focused training with a reasonable stimulus set and a timeframe that 
was appealing to participants, but may not have allowed us to see if improvement could have progressed 
even more. This is perhaps one advantage of allowing participants to access web-based training on their 
own time (e.g., Motohashi-Saigo & Hardison, 2009; Wang & Munro, 2004) although this approach 
involves some loss of control by the researchers. In addition, the current study’s stimuli were presented in 
isolation. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of context on the perception and production 
of vowel duration. Another challenge for training studies is the issue of retention. Few studies (e.g., 
Bradlow et al., 1999; Wang & Munro, 2004) have reported findings on the retention of skill improvement 
although learners who continue to receive L2 input are well positioned to maintain their skills. 
Finally, a recurring theme across L2 studies is variability. In fact, the successful auditory training studies 
that began 25 years ago were followed by others that often referred to adopting the high variability 
training paradigm. While it is important to recognize that including versus excluding variability in 
training likely contributes to more robust perceptual category development and the chances for 
generalization, this variability has been controlled. Studies generally record and present stimuli under 
sound-attenuated conditions where rate and style of speech are monitored, and talkers may not represent 
the full range of talker characteristics. This contrasts with the natural language environment where 
variability across multiple dimensions may impact the perceptual system simultaneously. 
CONCLUSION AND PEDAGOGICAL IMPLICATIONS 
Over the years, as more research has been conducted on the acquisition of nonnative sounds, more 
sources of variability have been found that affect learner performance. As with previous perception 
training studies, the current investigation on the acquisition of Japanese vowel duration found significant 
effects of vowel type, preceding consonant, and the talker’s voice during training. To these, the current 
study added pitch pattern and syllable location of the vowels. Although these findings paint an even more 
complex picture of L2 perception and production, they help to explain variable learner performance. 
Classroom teachers could use the above findings on factors affecting perceptual accuracy to guide their 
selection of materials for learners. To build perceptual categories that are robust to stimulus and talker 
variability, L2 learners need multimodal exposure to different types of speech, including a range of 
Tomoko Okuno and Debra M. Hardison L2 Japanese Vowel Training 
 
Language Learning & Technology 76 
talkers and phonetic contexts. Visual feedback from increasingly accessible technological tools can help 
to focus training on challenging features of L2 speech. It is encouraging to note the positive comments 
from participants in research studies toward the use of pitch displays (e.g., Hardison, 2004), spectrograms 
(Olson, 2014), and waveforms (Motohashi-Saigo & Hardison, 2009) in their L2 learning. In fact, some 
learners have asked why such tools are not a regular part of language instruction. Given the constraints on 
and expectations for the use of classroom time, teachers may wish to explore the use of these displays by 
learners on their own or in groups outside the classroom. Research suggests that learners need less 
instruction on the use of these tools and may benefit earlier in their learning than we had thought although 
some degree of guidance is necessary and must be tailored to the learner population and the purpose of 
training. As Olson (2014) noted, visual feedback may be more suitable for some features (e.g., duration 
and pitch) than others. These tools need not be viewed as opponents to a communicative focus, but as 
supplements to help learners benefit from focused training on challenging features.

NOTES 
1. Sonority is a property of a segment and refers to the degree of acoustic energy. On a continuum, 
voiceless stops have the least sonority and vowels have the most. The difference in sonority values 
between two segments may contribute to perceptual distance and facilitate the detection of 
boundaries. The sonority difference between a stop (e.g., /k/) and a vowel is greater than that between 
a fricative (e.g., /s/) and a vowel. 
2. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (ηp2 = .01 = small, .06 = medium, .14 = large; Cohen, 
1988).

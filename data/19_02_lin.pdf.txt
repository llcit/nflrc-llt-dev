A META-SYNTHESIS OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION 
(CMC) IN SLA 
Huifen Lin, National Tsing Hua University 
This meta-analysis reports the results of a systematic synthesis of primary studies on the 
effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in second language 
acquisition (SLA) for the period 2000-2012. By extracting information on 21 features 
from each primary study, this meta-analysis intends to summarize the CMC research 
literature for the past decade by calculating an average effect size and performing a series 
of moderator analyses to factor out elements that might mediate the effect of such media in 
SLA. In total, 59 studies were identified as eligible after excluding three outlier studies, 
covering both published and unpublished studies. All studies were coded for learner 
characteristics (5 features), methodological characteristics (14 features) and publication 
characteristics (2 features), six of which were further analyzed as moderator variables. The 
results show that (a) there was a positive and medium overall effect for CMC used for 
instructional/learning purposes in SLA, (b) among the four language skills which CMC 
was intended to facilitate, writing skills produced the largest effect size, as did pragmatic 
competence, among the three language components, i.e. pragmatics, vocabulary and 
pronunciation explored in this meta-analysis; however this result should be interpreted as 
tentative since only one study measured pragmatic competence in the current meta-
analysis, and (c) smaller group studies produced a larger effect size than those using larger 
groups or no grouping.

INTRODUCTION 
As the amount of research on computer-mediated communication (CMC) in the second language 
acquisition (SLA) field increases, researchers have tended to define it as a more comprehensive approach 
without losing its uniqueness. Thorne (2008) defined CMC as “multimodal, often (but not exclusively) 
Internet-mediated communication” (p. 325), while an earlier definition given by Herring (1996) described 
it as “communication that takes place between human beings via the instrumentality of computers” (p.1). 
Ostensibly the difference between these two definitions lies in the fact that in the former, communication 
is taking place via the Internet, which offers features that were not previously affordable or were only 
limited via computers.  
As the functions of advanced communication technologies become more mature and easily accessible, the 
past two decades have witnessed an ever-increasing interest in using such communication technologies in 
the SLA field. According to Chun’s paper (2007), which summarizes the hot topics in the top two U.S. 
computer-assisted language learning (CALL) journals, CALICO and Language Learning &Technology 
(LLT), (CMC) and Web-based instruction are the two most popular topics. This interest in CMC topics is 
not an isolated observation; CALICO, for example, dedicated an entire issue [2005, volume 22(3)] to the 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology  86 
topic of CMC and foreign language learning. The still growing and accumulating research interest in 
CMC in SLA necessitates a research synthesis that summarizes and more importantly systematically 
synthesizes the effects of such communication technologies for a very wide range of SLA purposes. 
Meta-Analysis Related To CMC in SLA  
In technology disciplines, the very early uses of meta-analyses were for computer-assisted instruction 
(CAI) in general during the 1980s, but meta-analysis research on CALL was very limited (Felix, 2005). 
Table 1 presents a summary of the previous meta-analyses on the overall effectiveness of technology in 
language learning. As indicated, there were approximately eight meta-analyses carried out during the 
period of 2003-2013, covering topics from electronic glosses specifically to more generally technology-
supported SLA. The majority of these meta-analyses calculated effect sizes to represent the magnitude of 
the effectiveness of the technology-related treatment effects on SLA. The results, overall, favor the use of 
technology/computers as a means of facilitating SLA.  
Thus far, only two meta-analyses have focused on CMC studies, i.e. Lin, Huang, and Liou (2013) and 
Sauro (2011). These two research syntheses present a comprehensive picture of what has been 
investigated in terms of synchronous CMC (SCMC) effectiveness over the period 1990-2010. However, 
the limitations of and approaches adopted in these two syntheses preclude an unequivocal answer to the 
question of the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication in SLA. The author of the current 
study identified some issues that were unexplored in these two syntheses. The first is related to the 
approaches adopted to synthesize the studies. Sauro’s study employed a narrative review approach. 
According to Jackson (1980), narrative approach involves “…narrative discussions… [which] typify our 
attempts to make sense of the rapidly expanding research literature" (p.440). However his study does not 
deal with issues such as how treatment effects vary as a function of a single or a combination of other 
factors. Furthermore, the issue of “effectiveness” of SCMC in second language (L2) learning did not 
seem to be appropriately addressed in Sauro’s synthesis. Most of the review related to the effectiveness of 
SCMC on the development of communicative competences described treatments/strategies adopted in 
primary studies but not the actual “effect” resulting from such differences in treatment design. 
Whereas Lin et al. (2013) have examined the effectiveness of text-based synchronous CMC in SLA, their 
study suffers from some important limitations. First, the synthesis was only based on journal articles and 
dissertations, leaving the question open as to whether including other types of publications (e.g. 
conference papers, government reports, etc.) would produce different results. Additionally, out of the 10 
studies, 8 were journal articles, which raises a concern of publication bias in that published studies are 
more likely to report significant results. Second, the focus of the synthesis is on the synchronous mode of 
CMC; studies exploring asynchronous communication were omitted and therefore the synthesis was not 
able to provide a comprehensive picture of CMC intervention in SLA. Third, their meta-analysis tried to 
identify potential moderators that might differentiate the effect of SCMC; however, due to the small 
sample size of each of the moderating variables, i.e. group size, treatment intensity, L2 proficiency, etc., 
the results were rendered uninterpretable. The current meta-analysis aimed to expand the previous meta-
analyses and overcome their limitations. Specifically, it (a) included both published and unpublished 
studies related to CMC to present a comprehensive picture of the effectiveness of such interventions in 
the SLA field; (b) identified moderating variables that were not included in the previous meta-analyses, 
such as outcome measures; (c) analyzed the effects of the CMC interventions utilizing both fixed and 
random models of meta-analysis; (d) examined the effectiveness of CMC both at the language skill (i.e., 
reading, writing, speaking, and listening) and the language component (i.e., pronunciation, grammar and 
vocabulary) levels; and (e) made decisions and judgment calls at each step of the meta-analysis as 
transparent as possible following the transparency index established by Aytug et al. (2012).

Research Questions 
The following three research questions guided this meta-analysis: 
1. What is the overall effect of CMC on L2 learning compared to face-to-face communication or no 
opportunities for communication at all? 
2. Does the effectiveness of CMC differ depending on the language skills/components that it is 
intended to develop or reinforce?  
3. To what extent do the following learner and methodology features affect the effectiveness of CMC: 
(a) learners’ L1 and L2 (b) research context (c) grouping size (d) treatment length and (e) outcome 
measures, and is there a relationship between publication type and such effectiveness? 
Variables  
Several variables examined in this meta-analysis as moderators were mainly concerned with the 
methodological design of the primary studies. Factors such as the target language skill, group size, 
treatment length, learning context and learners’ first language (L1) and L2 were suspected to make a 
difference in the effectiveness of CMC. Certain language skills might be more effectively developed via 
functions or affordances available in certain CMC tools or modalities; therefore it is necessary to explore 
the relationship between these two variables. Communications involving multiple participants determine 
the nature of interaction and the degree of overlapping utterances, which might, in the long run, be either 
productive or counterproductive in terms of achieving the intended communication aims. Additionally, 
the level of exposure and the context in which this exposure is provided might also differentiate the 
effects, given our common conception that most language skills need a significant amount of time to 
master, and a learning context in which distractions are avoided and guidance and immediate assistance 
can be asked for may differentiate the effects between long vs. short and in-class vs. out-of-class 
treatment conditions. Furthermore, certain learner L1s might be beneficial or detrimental to L2 learning 
due to inter-language transfer or interference. 
Language Skills/Components 
Four targeted language outcomes were pursued to represent the effect of CMC (speaking, reading, writing 
and listening) along with three language components (vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation). Each 
primary study was classified into one of the seven outcome categories after examining its description of 
the dependent variable. A study may be classified into more than one category if it measures more than 
one skill (e.g., Chenoweth, Ushida, & Murday, 2006; Liang, 2006). In this study, we firstly examine the 
overall effect of CMC on different SLA outcomes and then discuss possible moderators that might 
mediate such an effect. 
Publication Bias 
Regardless of the equal contribution of empirical studies that found non-significant results to our 
understanding of the line of research, it seems common for journal editors to have a preference for 
publishing studies that found significant differences favoring the treatment instruction, resulting in a so-
called publication bias. This meta-analysis therefore explores if there is publication bias in the research on 
CMC, and its possible impact on the reported efficacy of CMC.  
Treatment length 
It is commonly held that the longer L2 learners are exposed to the target language or practice it, the more 
likely they are to acquire the language. Research on CMC has been conducted in studies ranging from a 
one-shot case study (Lee, 2009) lasting for 30 minutes to longitudinal studies lasting for more than two 
years (Chenoweth, Ushida, & Murday, 2006). Given that L2 skills take time to develop, it is worth 
examining if the length of treatment would have an impact on different levels of L2 learning.

Language Learning & Technology 89 
Group size 
CMC provides an electronic venue in which negotiation for meaning or negotiation work triggers 
students’ language development, and consequently contributes to successful SLA (Smith, 2004). Group 
size determines the dynamics of the interaction and the possible nature of the negotiation and turn-taking 
patterns. 
Research context 
Research context refers to the context in which CMC activities are conducted. Students might be more 
motivated to participate in activities that are integrated into class than when asked to do so after class 
without support or monitoring.  
Outcome measurement  
The measurement adopted in evaluating the effect of instructional interventions has served as a moderator 
variable in previous meta-analyses (i.e., Li, 2010; Norris & Ortega, 2000). Given the wide variety of 
standardized and unstandardized tests employed to measure different language learning outcomes, it 
would be valuable to discover whether certain measurements affect or mediate the effectiveness of CMC 
interventions.   
Learners’ L1 
SLA research has discussed the interference of students’ L1 in their learning of the L2, and the negative 
or positive transfer of L1 on L2 acquisition (Bennui, 2008; Fagan & Cheong, 1987). Although it is 
beyond the scope of this meta-analysis to examine how students’ L1 interferes with the L2 in a CMC 
environment, it is interesting to explore whether learners’ L1 has a role to play in the effectiveness of 
CMC in SLA.   
Learners’ L2 
Some languages are easier to learn than others, and learners might employ different learning strategies 
when learning different languages. It is worth investigating whether CMC technologies are more suitable 
for specific target languages than others. 
METHODS 
Identifying Primary Studies 
The following searching strategies were performed to first identify and then retrieve the potential primary 
studies to be included in this meta-analysis with reference to previous meta-analysis searching steps (Li, 
2010; Sauro, 2011). Firstly, electronic databases in the fields of (applied) linguistics, language 
learning/teaching and education overall were searched. The key words that were used for searching 
included computer-mediated communication, online interaction, computer-assisted-language learning, 
and computer-assisted instruction, in combination with tools commonly used for such purposes such as e-
mail, chat-rooms, blogs, and classroom management systems (CMS). Searches were limited to those 
related to language learning/teaching in an SLA context. The electronic databases used included, but were 
not limited to, Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts (LLBA), ERIC, Springer online Journal 
Archives, JSTOR, and Linguistics Abstracts Online. Secondly, electronic and print journals in the field of 
CALL, CAI, SLA and education overall were searched for relevant articles dating back to 2000. The 
major journals searched included, but were not limited to, Language Learning & Technology, CALICO, 
System, Computer-Assisted Language Learning, The Modern Language Journal, the Journal of 
Computer-Assisted Instruction, Computers & Education, Foreign Language Annals, the British Journal of 
Educational Technology, Second Language Writing, Language Learning, and Second Language 
Research. Third, previous CMC (Lin, et al., 2013; Sauro, 2011) and CALL meta-analyses (Felix, 2005, 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 90 
2008; Nguyen, 2008) were carefully read and references examined to identify CMC-related primary 
studies. Fourth, the reference sections of the retrieved CMC primary studies were scanned for potential 
studies. Fifth, Google Scholar was used with the same key words/combinations to identify lab (technical) 
reports, conference papers, and proceedings that were not officially published or may not have been 
identified through steps 1 to 4. Finally, ProQuest Digital Dissertation (PQDD) and Networked Digital 
Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) and the national library of the research team’s country 
were searched using the same keywords/combinations to retrieve research reports, unpublished theses and 
dissertations. It has to be noted that, as a result, most research reports, unpublished theses and 
dissertations retrieved are from Taiwan, the country of the research team. 
Inclusion Criteria 
With reference to the inclusion/exclusion criteria followed in previous meta-analyses, and considering the 
purpose of the current meta-analysis, the following criteria were developed and followed when 
determining the eligibility of the retrieved studies. A study must have met the following criteria in order 
to be included in this meta-analysis:  
1. The study was published between 2000 and 2012 (including online first studies). Technical 
reports and conference papers were also included in this meta-analysis to address the concern 
raised in previous meta-analyses that studies reporting significant findings were more likely to 
be published in journals (Norris & Ortega, 2006) and thus presented a potential bias to the 
results.  
2. The study investigated some form of CMC (e.g., e-mail, chat, video/audio conferencing, 
discussion forums, CMS, Moodle, etc.) either exclusively or in conjunction with other 
instructional strategies/intervention as long as the effect of CMC can be teased out by making 
comparisons between treatment groups for which the only difference between them is the CMC 
intervention.  
3. The study addressed the effect of CMC by examining or evaluating the change related to SLA 
during the process or by administering a posttest, both conditions requiring quantitative data.  
4. The study employed an experimental or quasi-experimental design.  
5. Studies recruited participants who were L2 or foreign language learners. 
6. The studies included should report adequate quantitative information for effect sizes to be 
calculated. 
7. For studies reporting across several sources, only one report was included in the meta-analysis. 
For example, if the same study was reported both in a dissertation and a journal, only one 
source of report was used.  
The Coding Scheme and Inter-Coder Reliability 
A team that included one meta-analyst and five research assistants who had all earned a Master’s degree 
in TESOL, and had received substantial training in research methodology and quantitative data analysis 
conducted the meta-analysis. Each coder was assigned roles both as a primary and secondary coder in that 
he/she had to independently code the assigned ten studies and then acted as a second coder of another. As 
such, each study was coded at least twice. The inter-coder reliability was calculated by comparing the 
agreement between codes given by the two coders for each variable, and a ratio was calculated by 
dividing the number of agreed-upon codes by the total number of codes generated for all variables. Each 
coder was asked to note down the page number or write the author’s description for high inference 
variables such as type of outcome measurements if the code demands subjective judgments. Disagreement 
between codes as well as high-inference codes went through another coding by another two coders and 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 91 
final codes were assigned based on resolved discussions or the best estimation. The final inter-coder 
reliability was 100% for publication and learner variables, and 95% for methodological variables. The 
coding scheme consisted of three major aspects of the retrieved studies, i.e., publication (one feature), 
learners (three features) and methodology (nine features) as presented in Table 2. A brief description is 
provided for features and descriptors that are not immediately clear in the following. For a complete

Outcome Measures 
Four categories were developed to code each study in terms of how outcomes were measured. Referring 
to Li (2010), Keck, Iberri-Shea, Tracy-Ventura, and Wa-Mbaleka (2006) and Thomas (1994), an outcome 
measure was coded as a standardized test if it was a well-established national or international 
standardized test such as the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), GEPT (Taiwan’s official 
General English Proficiency Test), or American Council on The Teaching of Foreign Languages(ACTFL) 
proficiency test; a measure was coded as an institutional assessment if it was developed and designed by 
an institution to screen or place students into different proficiency levels, such as the Tunghai English 
Placement Exam (Chiang, 2007), and BYU WebCAPE (Sanders 2005); a measure was coded as an in-
house assessment if it was developed by the researcher for the purpose of the study, and was coded as 
mixed if more than one measurement was adopted, e.g. Kost (2004) and Hung (2007). 
Group size 
Four categories were identified for grouping size. If a group consisted of two people, it was coded as 
“pair”; if three to six people, it was coded as “small”; if more than six people, it was coded as “large”; 
“mixed” was coded for studies in which the number of students in each group was not equal; “no 
grouping” was coded for studies in which the entire class participated as a group.  
Treatment Length 
All primary studies were examined for how long a treatment lasted, and three categories were created to 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 92 
identify studies with different treatment lengths. If the total period was no more than 10 weeks, it was 
coded as “short”; if it was 11-24 weeks, it was coded as “moderate”; if more than 24 weeks, it was coded 
as “long.” It should be noted that the treatment length was defined as the time period in which the entire 
research was conducted and did not necessarily reflect the exact amount of time that participants received 
the intervention. Although the latter is more desirable for precisely pinning down the effect of CMC, very 
few studies provided this information. Additionally, for studies that adopted an asynchronous mode, exact 
intervention time is difficult or even impossible to measure.  
Language Outcomes 
Four targeted language skills outcomes, i.e. speaking, reading, writing and listening, and three 
components of the language skills, vocabulary, grammar (grammatical competence) and pronunciation, 
were pursued to represent the effects of CMC. Each primary study was classified into one of the seven 
categories after examining its description of the dependent variable. It should be noted that a study may 
be classified into more than one category of language outcome if it measures more than one skill (i.e., 
Chenoweth, Ushida, & Murday, 2006; Liang, 2006).  
Effect Size Calculation for Individual Studies 
In this meta-analysis, a standardized mean difference, Hedge’s g, was computed for each study, and a 
summary/average effect size was computed to represent the overall effect of the CMC intervention. In 
practice, the standardized mean difference is calculated by dividing the mean difference in a study by its 
pooled standard deviation, which then becomes comparable across studies. Additionally, in order to 
minimize the variance among studies, a weighted mean is computed for each study to better estimate the 
summary mean. To do so, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance (see Formula 1). 
 
Formula 1 
This would give greater weight to studies with large sample sizes because it is commonly agreed that 
larger samples provide better estimates of population parameters (Bangert-Drowns, Hurley, & Wilkinson, 
2004; Hoffler & Leutner, 2007). A summary effect is then calculated to estimate the mean of a 
distribution of the weighted effect sizes calculated from each of the included studies. These procedures 
were followed by studies that report sufficient information based on which effect size calculation is 
possible. For studies that report incomplete information, the procedures suggested by Borenstein, Hedges, 
Higgins and Rothstein (2009) were followed.  
Data Analysis  
The independent set of weighted effect sizes was calculated following the aforementioned procedures. 
Furthermore, to test if the calculated effect sizes were significantly different from zero, confidence 
intervals were calculated. If the confidence intervals include zero, it means that the true mean effect size 
may include zero and thus the null hypothesis that the treatment effect is zero cannot be rejected at the p < 
.05 statistical significance level. Additionally, the width of the confidence level is also examined to 
represent the precision of the effects. To test the null hypothesis that all studies share a common effect 
size, a test of heterogeneity via Q-test was performed. A significant p-value < .05 would indicate that the 
true effects vary between studies and serve as evidence that there exist variables that might moderate the 
effectiveness of CMC intervention.

RESULTS 
Phase I: The Research Synthesis 
In total, 59 studies conducted between 2000 and 2012 were found as eligible studies for the meta-analysis. 
A list of the studies with substantive features related to publication and methodology is provided in 
Appendix B. Learner characteristics can be found in Appendix C. A first glimpse of both lists revealed a 
wide range of communication tools employed in the included studies. As indicated in Figure 1, 
approximately 22 studies carried out communication tasks utilizing different types of chat-enabling 
systems such as chat-rooms, Skype, IRC, and ICQ. The second most popular tools used were blogs 
followed by e-mails; both are prevalent tools for asynchronous communication. Classroom management 
systems (CMS) and self-developed platforms were also used in a couple of studies to support 
communication. 
 
Figure 1. Frequency count of communication tools used in the primary studies. 
To provide a profile of the study features, we summarized and tallied the number of frequency for each 
feature. Table 3 shows the learner characteristics of the included studies. Regarding participants’ L1, it 
was found that three out of the six L1s across the included studies dealt with Asian language speakers, i.e. 
Chinese, Korean and Japanese. This pattern of L1 speakers indicated a major research interest in CMC 
with the Asian learner population. In fact, in Jeon and Kaya’s (2006) meta-analysis on the effects of L2 
instruction on inter-language pragmatic development, they also found a similar pattern of research interest 
in participants who are Asian language speakers. In this meta-analysis, Chinese L1 speakers (N=32), in 
particular, were the most dominant L1 group among the three Asian language groups. Furthermore, close 
to a quarter (N=14) of the studies recruited mixed L1 participants. Further examination of this group of 
studies revealed that the L2 of the mixed L1 speakers were English, German and Spanish and the studies 
were all conducted in the U.S. Only one study dealt with either Arabic or Turkish L1 speakers, suggesting 
a population of L1 speakers that might merit more CMC research. Also shown in the table is the 
overwhelming number of studies whose target language is English, signaling that English, as the most 
popular and major tool of international communication, is still the L2 that receives most attention in 
second/foreign language classrooms. Another interesting picture which emerged from this synthesis is 
that rather than Asian languages, two European languages, i.e. Spanish and German, emerged as the L2, 
second to English, that most CMC researchers were interested in. These patterns regarding study 
participants’ L1 and L2 revealed that CMC studies have concentrated on Asian learners whose target 
languages are either an American or a European language and that there is very little research interest in 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 94 
learning any Asian languages as a second or foreign language. Regarding participants’ age, of the 42 
studies in which data on participants’ age is available, more than half recruited participants between 19 
and 24 years old from colleges. Five studies involved young learners between 9 and 15 years old, and 
nine recruited secondary or high school learners. These patterns reveal that adult learners at college level 
are still the prevailing target population of most L2 studies, and little research attention has been paid to 
very young learners.

The methodology characteristics of the included studies can be found in Table 4. As shown, the two target 
skills that received the most research attention in the CMC studies were writing (N=29) and speaking 
(N=23). Comparatively, very little research concentrated on the empirical effects of CMC on the receptive 
skills of listening and reading. This pattern of research interest regarding target skills might have to do 
with the communication tasks themselves that could be best mediated by certain communication devices. 
Widely used tools such as chat rooms, bulletin boards or e-mail are ideal venues for practicing speaking 
and writing rather than listening and reading.  Treatment length was further classified into three categories 
at the cut-off points of less than 10 weeks, between 11 and 24 weeks and more than 24 weeks. It was 
found that the majority of studies featured medium length treatments (N=33) lasting between three and six 
months, and only two featured long-term treatments that lasted more than six weeks. This might indicate 
that the right amount of exposure of learners to treatments is no longer than half a year to produce the 
optimal effect of communication via technology on learners’ target language development. A general 
consensus among SLA researchers is that treatments have to be offered for long enough for certain effects 
to be observed (Creswell, 2009); however, longer treatments involve the likelihood of participants being 
exposed to extraneous variables. Thus far, there has been no agreement on the most appropriate length of 
treatment. Our meta-analysis revealed that at least for SLA in the CMC context, most researchers agreed 
on treatment lengths of between three and six months.  
Trends of grouping across the studies were also synthesized. Twenty studies grouped students into pairs 
to maximize the amount of interaction for each individual learner. Thirteen studies put students into small 
groups of three and six learners. It was also observed that five studies did not employ any specific kind of 
grouping and only one employed large grouping. The overall pattern that more than half of the included 
studies adopted small groups clearly indicates the importance of maximizing interaction opportunities and 
reducing turn-taking among interlocutors in CMC studies. Most tasks were carried out in class (N=29) 
rather than after class (N=20). As for the different types of outcome measures, the results found a variety 
employed in the included studies. In-house measures developed by the primary researcher for the purpose 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 95 
of the study was the most prevalent type of outcome measure (N=45); standardized measurements were 
also used in eight studies. Institutional measurements, mostly used for screening purposes for beginners in 
individual institutions were scarcely used by CMC researchers, probably because the purposes of 
assessment differed significantly.

Phase II. The Quantitative Meta-Analysis 
The earlier section presents the overall profile of the 59 eligible studies included in this meta-analysis 
with regard to their substantive learner and methodological features. In this section we provide the results 
of the second phase analysis, namely, the results of effect size calculation. We present the results 
pertaining to each research question we prescribed for the current meta-analysis.  
Research question 1: What is the overall effect of CMC on L2 learning compared to face-to-face 
communication or no opportunities for communication at all? 
Our first research question asked about the overall effectiveness of computer-mediated communication on 
second language learning compared to face to face or no form of communication at all. To address the 
concern raised in previous meta-analyses that statistically biased effect sizes may exist due to the 
inclusion of studies that did not include a control/comparison group, such as a one-group only 
pretest/posttest design (Norris & Ortega, 2006), this meta-analysis first went through three analyses to 
examine whether there are significant gaps in the effect sizes calculated when including or excluding 
these studies. The data shown in Table 5 include the mean effect size (Hedge’s g), standard error, and the 
upper and lower limit under the 95% confidence level for the three separate analyses. As indicated, the 
mean effect sizes obtained when pooling all the studies is .461 under the random-effects model and 0.408 
under the fixed-effects model (K=59), including the one-group studies being 0.323(K=15) under the 
random-effects model and 0.165 under the fixed-effects model, and including only two-group studies 
being 0.499(K=44) under the random-effects model and 0.587 under the fixed effects model. The 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 96 
obtained effect sizes under the three conditions of pooling were very close. Furthermore, the pair-wise 
comparison between one group studies and two group studies in effect size also shows no significant 
difference, Q(1)=1.214, p=.271. Since no significant differences in effect size were found between pools 
of studies including or excluding studies that employed a one-group only design, we interpreted the 
results based on the pool of 59 studies. As indicated, the overall mean effect size (Hedge’s g) of the 59 
studies was 0.41 (fixed-effects model) and 0.44 (random-effects model). According to Cohen (1988), the 
effect at this magnitude was moderate with approximately 79% of variance not accounted for by chance. 
The confidence interval is between 0.29 to 0.63 in the random-effects model and 0.34 and 0.47 under the 
fixed-effects model, both not including zero, indicating that the effect size derived from the included 
studies is trustworthy and does not happen by chance.  If we interpreted the calculated effect size in terms 
of standard deviation, the CMC experimental group students scored on average of 0.40 (random-effects) 
or 0.44 (fixed-effects) of a standard deviation above the scores of the control group with or without other 
means of communication.

Research question 2. Does the effectiveness of CMC differ depending on the language skills/components 
that it is intended to develop or reinforce?  
Our second research question explored if the effectiveness of CMC would differ depending on the 
specific language skill it is employed to facilitate. Table 6 displays the overall effect of CMC intervention 
(as compared to face to face or no such intervention). The relative effect of CMC in terms of different 
language skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening, overall) is also shown with the number of studies 
contributing to that effect size, the calculated mean effect size (Hedge’s g), the standard error and both the 
lower and upper limit at the 95% confidence interval. CMC, in general, has a small to medium effect on 
language learning (Hedge’s g=0.461). The 95% confidence intervals do not include zero meaning that 
such an effect does not happen by chance. For language skills, a wide range of effect sizes was found 
across the different language skills and their components. The magnitude of the effects ranges between 
0.96 (pragmatics) and 0.32 (listening). Surprisingly, the use of CMC resulted in a negative effect on 
vocabulary learning (-0.616). Following Cohen’s (1988) guidelines, the calculated effect sizes reflect a 
combination of small, medium and large magnitudes. That is, CMC has a small effect on listening, 
speaking and reading, a moderate effect on writing and pronunciation, and a large effect on pragmatics. 
To sum up, the results of Table 6 indicate that CMC is most effective in developing writing (g=0.638), 
followed by reading (g=0.519) and listening (g=0.505). It is least effective for the development of 
speaking (g=0.307) under the random-effects model. A similar pattern was also revealed under the fixed 
effects model. The overall effectiveness for the four different skills was found to be significant because 
the Q-text shows that there were significant differences in their mean effect sizes, Q(4)=22.233, p < .001. 
As for the language components, the random effects model found the largest effect size for pragmatic 
competence, followed by pronunciation, and a negative effect was found for vocabulary. An identical 
pattern was found under the fixed effects model. The above results have to be interpreted with caution, 
though, due to the small number of studies included in the categories of listening and reading, and the 
three components. The problem is particularly severe for pragmatics, which included only one study.

With some categories of studies underrepresented and others overrepresented, we cannot draw a complete 
and accurate picture with confidence from the current meta-analysis regarding the causal effect of CMC 
on different language skills development.

might not add up to 59; cstatistics on the left are computed based on Random-effects model(Q(7)=28.530, p < .001) while the 
statistics on the right are based on the fixed-effects model(Q(7)=63.690, p < .001). 
Research question 3. To what extent do the following learner and methodology features affect the 
effectiveness of CMC: (a) learners’ L1 and L2 (b) research context (c) grouping size (d) treatment length, 
and (e) outcome measures, and is there a relationship between publication type and such effectiveness?  
Our last research question aimed to identify factors from the publication, learner and methodological 
levels that might moderate the effectiveness of CMC. To answer the research question, publication type 
and selected features of the learner characteristics and methodologies of the included studies were 
analyzed to examine whether they would moderate the overall effectiveness of computer-mediated 
communications. A series of Q-tests was performed, and the obtained Q statistics and associated p values 
(set at .05 level) were used to examine whether a certain variable was a significant moderator.  The 
moderators examined included publication type, research context, group size, treatment length, learners’ 
L1 and L2, and outcome measures. Table 7 presents the results of the moderator analysis followed by a 
more detailed description of the pair-wise comparison results for the significant moderators. For 
publication type, over half of the studies were journal articles that generated a small effect size (g=.322). 
Comparatively, the five conference papers generated the largest effect size (g=1.015), while the effect 
sizes calculated for the unpublished theses and dissertations were roughly moderate. In terms of research 
context, studies in which CMC tasks were conducted both in and after class produced the largest effect, 
which is almost twice the effect of those only conducted after class. The research context as revealed from 
the descriptors seems to favor a setting in which CMC activities were carried on into a non-class setting. 
Regarding group size, a clear picture has emerged that smaller groups did contribute to the beneficial 
effect of computer-mediated communication compared to larger groups. Twenty studies in this meta-
analysis divided students into pairs and resulted in a close to large effect of language learning. The large 
group involving more than six interlocutors, as can be expected, generated the least effect. The analysis 
comparing different treatment lengths reveals that a medium length of treatment lasting between 10 and 
24 weeks induced the best effect, followed by a treatment length of less than 10 weeks. The long-term 
treatment, surprisingly, resulted in the smallest effect. These seemingly unexpected results might again 
need to be interpreted with great caution because there were only two studies in this meta-analysis that 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 98 
employed treatments that were longer than 24 weeks, which render the comparisons unreliable.  
Our analysis of students’ L1 as a moderator of CMC effectiveness revealed an astounding picture. Studies 
using Arabic, Japanese and Turkish L1 speakers generated the largest effect size, while the Korean and 
English L1 speakers had the smallest effect sizes. While there has been discussion on such issues as 
learners’ L1 perhaps aiding or interfering with their L2 learning depending on their inter-language 
development, it is not easy to draw a clear cause-and-effect relationship between learners’ L1 and the 
CMC effectiveness in the current meta-analysis. Given that variables other than learners’ L1 might also 
play a significant role in such a relationship, the results are presented as suggestive rather than 
informative. Regarding outcome measures employed in the primary studies, the results indicated that 
studies using standardized tests yielded the largest effect size, while both in-house and mixed tests 
generated small but approximately equal effect size. Studies that employed institutional tests, on the 
contrary, generated a negative effect size.

analysis only included studies from which the data for the certain variable were available; the first value shown is based on the 
random-effects model followed by the value based on the fixed-effects model 
To further examine whether the differences between the categories of moderators are significant, a series 
of pair-wise comparisons was conducted. Generally speaking, the random-effects model tends to give a 
more conservative estimate of the effect size than the fixed-effects model. As indicated in Table 8, two of 
the seven moderators were found to be significant, and might impact the effectiveness of the CMC 
intervention under the random-effects model, while six moderators were found to be significant under the 
fixed-effects model. The pairwise comparisons indicated that the effect sizes calculated from conference 
papers were significantly more pronounced than those of unpublished dissertations, theses and journal 
articles. Unpublished dissertations and theses also generated significantly larger effect sizes than journal 
articles.  
As for research context, pair-wise comparisons revealed that studies which employed CMC activities both 
in and after class produced larger effect size than studies that used them only in class. The difference in 
effect size between after-class studies and both studies were not significant. In terms of group size, pair-
grouping studies overwhelmingly outperformed studies that used either small, large or no grouping at all. 
Regarding treatment length, significant differences were found between short and long treatments and 
medium and short treatments, with short treatments generating larger effect size than long treatments, and 
medium-length treatments producing larger effect size than short treatments.  
Our last significant moderator is learners’ L2. Of the three pairwise comparisons, the only significant 
difference is between English and Spanish L2 learners, with studies of English as an L2 producing bigger 
effect sizes than Spanish L2 studies. Effect sizes contributed by each primary study based on skills can be 
found in Appendix B.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION 
The purpose of this meta-analysis was to scrutinize the effect of CMC intervention on SLA in terms of the 
four language skills and their components. It also identified the moderator variables that might impact its 
overall effectiveness. The analysis found that overall, CMC has a positive and medium effect on language 
learning as measured from the immediate posttests. Furthermore, CMC seems to be more effective in 
facilitating the acquisition of writing skills but less effective in developing oral skills. In the following we 
discuss the findings and provide plausible explanations.  
First, with regard to difference in effect size as a result of grouping, the descriptive statistics found that 
putting students in pairs generated the largest effect size, followed by small groups of three to six 
students; interactions involving large groups generated the smallest effect size. Pair grouping significantly 
outperformed either small group, large group or no grouping at all (i.e., class-based). Paired grouping 
studies are found to generate almost twice the effect of the class-based studies. Jenks (2009) examined the 
interactional features of multi-participant voice-based chat rooms. In his review of previous studies on the 
same topic, but conducted in text-based chat rooms, he indicated that overlapping utterances are one 
unique feature of communication involving multiple participants, and that these utterances tend to be 
“disrupted, disjointed or delayed” (Herring, 1999) and “…counterproductive to achieving comprehensible 
communication” (Jenks, 2009, p. 28). In voice-based CMC involving multiple participants, 
incomprehensibility often accompanies overlapping talk because previous utterances are not available as 
they are in text-based CMC. In order to take control of the ongoing discussions, students employ different 
strategies such as the use of abbreviations and emoticons, especially when they cannot see each other. The 
above strategies to enhance comprehensibility both in text or voice-based CMC due to multiple 
participants would not be necessary when only two interlocutors are involved in the interaction, and so 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 101 
rapid interaction is more likely in one-to-one than in multi-participant CMC. Definitely, the social 
dynamics with regard to turn-taking, equality, consensus and interruption are also different between one-
to-one and multiple-participant CMC (Warschauer, 1997), and these characteristics unique to the process 
of each mode of communication would also have an impact on subsequent learning outcomes.   
Second, studies incorporating CMC activities as in-class activities generated a significantly larger effect 
than those using after-class activities. This finding is not surprising at all given that learners tend to be 
more concentrated and focused on in-class activities rather than when engaged in the same activities after 
class where distractions might be abundant. Direct manipulation of in-class activities is also easier as any 
questions that arise may be more likely to be immediately resolved. This meta-analysis also found that 
incorporating CMC activities both in and after class generated a larger effect size than conducting CMC 
activities only in-class. This finding would encourage an expansion of instructional activities from a 
classroom setting to after-class settings in which autonomous and independent learning might take place. 
Third, with regard to treatment length, the study showed that short treatments (≤ 10 weeks) generated the 
largest effect size, followed by moderate treatments (11–24 weeks). The longer treatments (> 24 weeks) 
generated the smallest effect size. Pairwise comparisons showed a significant difference between short 
and moderate and short and long treatments, with short treatments outperforming the others. This finding 
is contradictory to our expectation given the fact that language skills take time to develop, and any subtle 
changes might not be immediately measureable. The meta-analyst suspects that this finding might be 
attributable to outcome measures since all long treatments were measured using either in-house or 
institutional assessments, while the short treatments were measured using a mixture of assessments 
including standardized tests and, as will be discussed later, studies employing standardized tests yielded 
the largest effect sizes. The above discussion aside, treatment length in this meta-analysis was defined as 
the total period of time during which the primary study was conducted, which might not actually reflect 
the intensity of the treatments the participants were exposed to. Furthermore, task design, language skill 
and interlocutor types may all have to be considered before we can pin down the effect of treatment 
length on SLA.  
Fourth, in terms of the effect of outcome measure, it was found that the majority of the included studies 
employed in-house measurements (K=45), which are defined as assessments developed by the researcher 
specifically for the purpose of a study. Among the 59 studies, only 8 employed standardized tests. The 
descriptive statistics show that standardized tests under the random-effects model produced the largest 
effect size. Institutional measurements generated the smallest effect size consistently under both models. 
Close examination found that one third of the in-house measurements failed to report any kind of 
reliability, while all standardized tests reported either test or inter-rater reliability. Cross-tabulation also 
found that in-house measurements were attributable to the majority of negative effect sizes, i.e. out of 14, 
12 were contributed by in-house measurement studies. In the SLA area, in-house and tailor-made 
assessments seem to be the norm of measurement to accommodate the diversities of student level, 
instructional treatments and testing logistics. However, failure to report test validity and reliability might 
render the results debatable. The choice of measurement is critical in empirical studies. It is not likely to 
draw a causal relationship between the treatments and type of measurement. However, in this meta-
analysis, standardized tests were associated with small, medium and large effect sizes evenly and 
therefore seem to be more trustworthy compared to in-house and other types of measurement for the 
majority of which the report of any form of reliability is missing.  
Fifth, with regard to publication type, this meta-analysis found that conference papers yielded the largest 
effect size among the four different publication types. Out of the six conference papers included, four 
generated an effect size larger than 1, which might explain why this type of publication “outperforms” the 
other types which generated more evenly-distributed and moderate effect sizes. It might make little sense 
to argue that the effect of CMC would be contingent on the type of publication, where it would appear 
especially that publication bias examined previously in the former part of the paper showed no or little 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 102 
bias in the included studies. Cross tabulation incorporating the research context showed that all of the 
conference papers were based on studies conducted in foreign language contexts, while the journal 
articles were based on studies in both foreign and second language contexts. And, as previously 
discussed, studies conducted in foreign language contexts yielded larger effect sizes than those conducted 
in second language contexts.  
Sixth, to explore if learners’ L2 has an impact on the effectiveness of CMC, effect sizes were calculated 
for the four major target languages examined in the primary studies. It was found that CMC integrated 
into the instruction of L2 English was significantly more effective than for German and Spanish, although 
a significant difference is only found between English and Spanish, with the former generating almost 
twice the effect of the latter under the fixed-effects model, and three times under the random-effects 
model. Cross-tabulation of the results related to learners’ L1 indicated that out of the 46 L2 English 
studies, 34 were conducted with Chinese L1 learners, while out of the 10 L2 Spanish studies, five were 
conducted with English L1, and three with mixed L1 participants.  The high motivation associated with 
the learning of English as an international language in the era of globalization is one plausible explanation 
for this finding. Furthermore, as far as the meta-analyst knows, English has always been the number one 
foreign language that Chinese learners endeavor to have a good command of. The enthusiasm for learning 
English is also revealed in government policies of making English required instruction in the curriculum 
from primary school level in all Chinese-speaking countries.  
Finally, to ascertain whether learners’ L1 moderates the effectiveness of CMC, effect sizes were 
calculated for the L1s in the primary studies. The majority of the included studies were conducted with 
Chinese L1 learners (K=32), while more than a quarter of the primary studies (K=14) have mixed L1 
participants. Pair-wise comparisons revealed a complicated picture. Overall, studies conducted with 
Japanese, Korean and Arabic L1 learners generated a significantly larger effect size than the other L1 
studies. The fact that only 1 study each was conducted with learners of these three L1s, and that there are 
14 studies with students from mixed L1 backgrounds renders a reasonable interpretation of the results 
impossible. However, this finding also highlights the need for future research to conduct studies with 
participants from less-studied L1 backgrounds.  
The results of this meta-analysis contributed to our understanding of SLA theory from the socio-cultural 
and interactionist perspectives. Interaction opportunities in a socio-cultural context provide likelihood for 
negotiations in that input becomes comprehensible, and learners’ attention can be drawn to form and ways 
of developing discourses (Gass & Varonis, 1994). This meta-analysis lends empirical supports to the 
Interaction Hypothesis (Long, 1996) that online interactions/communications mediated by 
computers/technology can generate similar or even superior opportunities for L2 learning than are found 
in face-to-face settings. Systematic variables of the wide CMC context, though, should be considered. 
Based on the results of this meta-analysis, contextual variables such as research context, grouping, 
amount of exposure to the interaction, i.e., treatment length, and learners’ L2 may exert different effects 
of such interactions. The CMC interactions may vary significantly when L2 learners carried out the tasks 
in class or after class. The number of interlocutors who interact simultaneously online (e.g., pairs versus 
small group versus large group versus whole-class) and learners’ L2 are also variables that might 
systematically moderate the effect on amount and quality of online interactions.   
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH SUGGESTIONS 
This meta-analysis is not without its limitations, which may influence the generalizability of the results. 
First, it included a higher ratio of certain types of publications, i.e. conference papers, theses and 
dissertations from the meta-analyst’s country. The convenience of more immediate and easier access to 
these studies may have caused Chinese L1 participants to be overrepresented in the sample. Second, the 
division of certain variables, such as treatment length and task type into different levels for moderator 
analysis is somewhat arbitrary and involves a certain degree of subjectivity. Different division criteria 
Huifen Lin A Meta-Synthesis on CMC Effectiveness 
 
Language Learning & Technology 103 
imposed on these variables may cause the results to be totally different. Third, certain studies which failed 
to provide sufficient quantitative data for effect size calculation but which met the inclusion criteria had to 
be excluded from the final pool. Thus this meta-analysis only reveals part of the picture of the CMC 
findings in our field. This limitation also extends to studies that have little visibility or that the meta-
analyst has little or no access to.  
The results revealed the following issues to be taken up in future research. First, English is still the 
dominant L2 that draws intense research interest in SLA. This phenomenon is probably due to the 
overwhelming population that speaks the language and hence the need for learners to sharpen their 
English skills. There is a need for future studies to look at less-studied languages, such as Chinese, 
Japanese and Arabic. The disproportionate representation of individual L2s in the dataset makes it 
impossible to pin down the differential effects of different L2s on language learning outcomes. The same 
observation could also be extended to the unequal number of studies with participants from different L1 
backgrounds, educational levels and employing various interlocutor types.  More research is needed that 
involves primary and secondary school students, learning Spanish, French, and German as a second 
language, and having native speakers and teachers as interlocutors. Second, the current meta-analysis also 
revealed that the outcome measures employed by primary researchers to assess certain treatment effects 
were quite diversified, ranging from e-mail messages, blog entries to summary writing to evaluate writing 
ability. Effects are likely to fluctuate depending on the ease of the measurement tasks, that is, effects 
might be greater in studies that employ indirect measurements to assess writing, such as the use of a cloze 
test, than in studies in which essay writing is used to evaluate students’ writing ability. Third, it was found 
that only a few studies assessed the delayed effect of the CMC interventions. This raises the question of 
whether the linguistic knowledge acquired via CMC interactions would be sustained over time, and 
internalized as part of the learners’ language system. As far as the meta-analyst knows, there were only a 
couple of meta-analyses that have specifically scrutinized the overall effectiveness of CMC tools in SLA. 
However, the findings of this meta-analysis can be described as tentative at best. As with the majority of 
meta-analyses across disciplines, this one attempts to incorporate as many studies as possible to provide a 
comprehensive picture of the question under study (Cooper, 2003; Ortega, 2010); however, the obtained 
overall effectiveness could be misleading without employing a “thick description of the context, content, 
people and procedures involved” (Kern, 2006, p.189). Future meta-analysts are therefore called to 
supplement quantitative measures with thick description whenever possible. Additionally, to tackle the 
long-lasting critique confronting meta-analyses which compare apples to oranges, prospective meta-
analysis may be an alternative, where well-planned empirical studies, sound in their research design and 
theoretical framework, are conducted for the purpose of a future meta-analysis (Berlin & Ghersi, 2005; 
Oswald & Plonsky, 2010).

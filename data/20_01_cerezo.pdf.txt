TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INPUT-BASED PRACTICE IN CALI: 
THE REVELATIONS OF A TRIANGULATED RESEARCH DESIGN 
Luis Cerezo, American University 
Research shows that computer-generated corrective feedback can promote second 
language development, but there is no consensus about which type is the most effective. 
The scale is tipped in favor of more explicit feedback that provides metalinguistic 
explanations, but counterevidence indicates that minimally explicit feedback of the 
right/wrong type may promote comparable learning outcomes. Addressing these 
conflicting findings, the present study investigated the effects of different types and 
amounts of practice as variables that may moderate the effectiveness of computerized 
right/wrong feedback. Fifty-two learners of intermediate Spanish completed either 28 or 
56 items of an input-based task with 2 or 4 options targeting Spanish past counterfactual 
conditional sentences. Quantitative results on achievement scores showed that differences 
in amount of practice might contribute to explaining the conflicting findings in the 
literature. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of participant mouse-click histories 
illustrated participant use of elimination strategies to redefine the 4-option tasks, while 
participant think-alouds revealed the increased boredom and fatigue induced by the extra 
amount of practice. This study thus contributes to the debate on the effects of different 
types of computerized feedback and the development of hybrid and online language 
learning programs, while underscoring the importance of triangulating data from multiple 
sources.

INTRODUCTION 
Increasingly, studies in second language acquisition (SLA) have employed the computer for two main 
purposes: as a methodological tool—for example, to randomize participants, deliver second language (L2) 
input consistently, collect achievement data, or record online behavior (e.g., Sanz, Morales-Front, 
Zalbidea, & Zárate-Sández, 2015)—and as a pedagogical tool—to either retrieve or process input, 
mediate communication among learners, or provide instruction (e.g., Levy, 2009). The latter case, which 
is often referred to as computer-assisted language instruction (CALI), constitutes the focus of this study. 
In CALI the computer acts as an e-tutor, that is, software with the ability to (a) engage learners in some 
sort of pedagogical practice and (b) provide corrective feedback in response to errors by the learners. 
Hitherto, over 20 studies have shown that computer-generated corrective feedback can help learners 
develop their knowledge and skill of a variety of L2 grammatical structures (see Cerezo, 2012 for a 
review). However, in line with the more extensive literature on human-delivered feedback (see the meta-
analyses by Li, 2010; Lyster & Saito, 2010; Mackey & Goo, 2007; Russell & Spada, 2006) the jury is still 
out as to which type of feedback is the most effective. Out of at least 11 CALI studies (including five 
doctoral dissertations) that have investigated this issue empirically, seven found an edge for feedback

providing grammatical rules (Bowles, 2008; Cerezo, 2010; Lado, Bowden, Stafford, & Sanz, 2014; Lin, 
2009; Nagata, 1993; also reported in Nagata & Swisher, 1995; Rosa & Leow, 2004; Sachs, 2011) while 
four found that less informative feedback of the right/wrong type may be equally effective (Camblor, 
2006; Hsieh, 2008; Moreno, 2007; Sanz & Morgan-Short, 2004). 
The varying effectiveness of right/wrong feedback in these CALI studies may possibly be due to 
differences in their experimental treatments, including, but not limited to, the type and amount of 
computerized practice provided. For example, Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) argued that their group 
with right/wrong feedback performed comparably to that with grammatical explanations, contra Rosa and 
Leow (2004) (where it performed significantly worse), because their treatment included more practice 
items (56 instead of 28), which is crucial in less explicit learning conditions. Also, while both studies 
used input-based practice in the form of multiple-choice interpretation tasks, these differed, among other 
things, in the number of choices they provided. As Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) put it: 
Our learners were presented with only two possible answers for each item, whereas participants 
in “Rosa and Leow (2004)” had to decide among four options. Consequently, they were required 
to eliminate three incorrect options in order to identify the correct choice. [W]ithout any explicit 
information, 18 practice items containing the target form [plus 10 distractors, totaling 28 items] 
supplied along with three incorrect options simply may not have been enough evidence to be 
conducive for noticing or understanding the target form. (pp. 70–71) 
The present study is the first to empirically investigate these claims, in an attempt to determine whether 
the differences in type and amount of input-based practice between Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) and 
Rosa and Leow (2004) contribute to explaining the conflicting results of right/wrong feedback in the 
CALI literature. To do so, Rosa and Leow’s group with right/wrong feedback was cloned into four 
experimental groups that differed in (a) the type of input-based practice (2 or 4 options) and (b) the 
amount of practice (28 or 56 items). Additionally, learner online behavior was recorded via mouse-click 
tracking and think-alouds, which served to triangulate quantitative results and revealed potentially 
intervening variables. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Type of Input-Based Practice 
An incipient number of CALI studies (Morgan-Short & Wood Bowden, 2006; Nagata, 1998a, 1998b) 
suggests that output-based practice (in which learners produce the target structure) yields higher L2 
grammar development than input-based practice (in which learners recognize or interpret the structure 
from several options) (though see the meta-analysis by Shintani, Li, & Ellis, 2013). Input-based practice, 
however, has been more profusely used in the literature, probably because it can be more easily 
programmed (the number of participant responses is limited). Specifically, input-based tasks were used in 
eight of the 11 (73%) CALI studies that have empirically investigated the effects of type of feedback, and 
in three of the four (75%) studies that found no differences between right/wrong feedback and feedback 
with grammatical explanations. 
Despite this preference for input-based tasks, very few CALI studies (all unpublished doctoral 
dissertations) have investigated which task-features may enhance their effectiveness (see Table 1 for a 
summary of studies). Moreno (2007) found that pushing learners to focus their attention on the targeted 
structure to complete a picture interpretation task did not yield superior learning gains. Medina (2008) 
found that asking learners to spot and highlight the targeted structure after reading a text produced 
superior written production gains. And Torres (2013) found that differently complex tasks yielded similar 
learning gains.

Given this paucity of studies, there is an urgent need to further investigate the effects of different input-
based task features. According to Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004), one possible avenue is to investigate 
the effects of different numbers of options. While they do not provide a psycholinguistic rationale for why 
different numbers of options may be differently “conducive for noticing or understanding the target form” 
(p. 71), at least two hypotheses may be invoked. On the one hand, based on the Noticing Hypothesis (e.g., 
Schmidt, 2001) it could be posited that an input-based task with more options may distract learner 
attention away from the targeted form. On the other, based on the Depth of Processing Hypothesis (e.g., 
Craik & Tulving, 1975) it could be argued that the additional cognitive effort devoted to identify the 
targeted form from a larger number of distractors may result in more robust intake. To investigate this, the 
present study compared the effects of two computerized input-based tasks differing in the number of 
options (2 vs. 4) on L2 grammar development. 
Amount of Practice 
The old dictum “practice makes perfect” suggests that the amount of practice provided may moderate the 
effects of a task on L2 grammar development. Yet, no published CALI study has empirically investigated 
this. In the general SLA literature, studies can be divided into two groups. One group investigated the 
effects of amount of practice separately (Adams, 2003; Ahmadian, 2011; Ahmadian & Tavakoli, 2011; 
Bygate, 1996, 2001; Gass, Mackey, Fernández, & Álvarez-Torres, 1999; Lynch & Maclean, 2000, 2001; 
Wang, 2009). The other investigated the effects of amount of practice in combination with or in 
comparison to other variables, such as the provision of grammatical explanations, input, feedback, or 
planning (Adams, 2003; Ahmadian & Tavakoli, 2011; Hawkes, 2012; Leow, 1998; Sheppard, 2006; 
Wang, 2009). A summary of studies is included in Table 2. 
The vast majority of studies in Table 2 have operationalized practice as tasks, investigating the 
developmental effects of repeating the same task instance (e.g., narrating the same video excerpt) or task 
type (e.g., narrating different video excerpts). Most studies have used oral tasks (e.g., conducting an 
interview) and minimally written tasks (e.g., narrating a picture sequence). There is great variance in the 
number of elicited repetitions (from 1 to 11), the intervals between them (from no break to 3 weeks), and 
the overall time span between pretest and posttest (from 1 minute to 6 months). Because tasks prioritize 
communicative goals over the usage of a specific linguistic form (e.g., Ellis, 2003), most of these studies 
have measured L2 development holistically, quantifying change in combined areas of language (e.g., 
grammar and vocabulary) in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) with different units. Also, 
due to small sample sizes and low or inconsistent usage of linguistic forms by the learners, these studies 
have mostly used descriptive rather than inferential statistics. 
As pointed out by several authors (e.g., Ahmadian & Tavakoli, 2011; Ellis, 2009), overall studies have 
shown that task repetition has clear benefits for L2 complexity and fluency, but not necessarily for 
accuracy—rare exceptions are the case studies by Bygate (1996) and Lynch and McLean (2000, 2001) 
and the experimental studies by Adams (2003), Gass et al. (1999), and Wang (2009). These results can be 
explained from a psycholinguistic perspective. According to Levelt’s (1989) speech production model, 
when first completing a task learners are busy figuring out what they want to say (conceptualization), 
which leaves little attentional capacity for translating their ideas into actual speech (encoding and 
articulation). In subsequent repetitions, learners can concentrate on improving their language 
performance, but given the limited nature of attentional capacity, attending to one dimension of 
performance (e.g., complexity or fluency) is likely to compromise another (e.g., accuracy), as posited by 
the Trade-Off Hypothesis (Skehan, 2009).

Granted, it could be posited that the potentially beneficial effects of task repetition on accuracy might 
arise in the medium or long run, rather than immediately (Larsen-Freeman, 2009). Yet, using massed 
repetitions over an extended period of time, Bygate (2001) and Ahmadian (2011) found positive effects 
for fluency and complexity only. On the other hand, task repetition might need to be supplemented with 
other pedagogical interventions. Several studies combined task repetition with interventions such as 
exposure to additional input (Sheppard, 2006); exposure to feedback, either implicitly through the task 
(Leow, 1998) or explicitly after task completion (Sheppard, 2006); participation in “noticing phases”, in 
which participants compared their performance with a model (Adams, 2003); participation in form-
focused activities (Hawkes, 2012); and planning, either ahead of time (Wang, 2009) or online through 
untimed tasks (Ahmadian & Tavakoli, 2011; Wang, 2009). Interestingly, all of these studies found 
significant gains in accuracy during subsequent repetitions. 
Building upon this body of literature, and using right/wrong feedback as an additional pedagogical 
intervention, the present study investigated the effects of different amounts of computerized practice (28 
vs. 56 items) on L2 grammar development. 
RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES 
Existing research presents contradicting results about the effects of different types of computerized 
feedback on L2 grammar development. Studies like Rosa and Leow (2004) showed an edge for feedback 
with grammatical explanations, while other studies like Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) obtained that 
right/wrong feedback can promote comparable learning. Following Sanz and Morgan-Short’s claims, this 
study is first to investigate whether type and amount of input-based practice may moderate the effects of 
right/wrong computerized feedback. Specifically, the following research questions (RQs) and hypotheses 
(Hs) are formulated: 
RQ1. On type of input-based practice. Does type of computerized input-based practice (2 or 4 options) 
have differential effects on L2 development? 
H1. No. Learners completing an input-based task with either 2 or 4 options will show 
comparable L2 development. Hitherto, no study has investigated this issue, so the null 
hypothesis is formulated. 
RQ2. On amount of input-based practice. Does amount of computerized input-based practice (28 or 56 
items) have differential effects on L2 development? 
H2. Yes. Learners completing 56 items of a computerized input-based task will show 
significantly greater L2 development. Studies have shown that more practice combined 
with corrective feedback promotes higher accuracy gains. 
METHOD 
Participants 
The participants in this study were 52 undergraduate students of intermediate Spanish at a northeastern 
university in the United States meeting these criteria: (a) they were native speakers of English; (b) they 
neither spoke nor had been formally exposed to any Romance language for more than two years; and (c) 
they demonstrated no ability to recognize or produce the targeted structure. 
Targeted Structure 
As in Rosa and Leow (2004), this study used two different types of Spanish counterfactual conditional 
sentences: one referring to the present or future with a result in the present (e.g., Si Joe estudiara español, 
entendería el discurso de Antonio Banderas [“If Joe studied Spanish, he would understand Antonio 
Banderas’ speech”]), the other referring to the past with a result in the present (e.g., Si Joe hubiera 
Luis Cerezo Type and Amount of Input-Based Practice in CALI 
 
Language Learning & Technology  108  
estudiado español, ahora entendería el discurso de Antonio Banderas [“If Joe had studied Spanish, he 
would now understand Antonio Banderas’ speech”]). The first type (henceforth referred to as non-
targeted structure) was used as a base structure to provide participants with a general framework on 
Spanish conditional sentences, and for distracting purposes. The second type was the targeted structure. 
Rosa and Leow selected this targeted structure for three reasons: (a) the likely unfamiliarity of 
intermediate Spanish students with the target rules, which minimizes a potential activation of prior 
knowledge; (b) the ease with which it can be contrasted with contrary-to-fact conditionals in the other 
tenses, present or future; and (c) the high level of complexity of the structures. 
Materials 
Experimental Task 
The pedagogical treatment for this study replicated the input-based task used in Rosa and Leow (2004) 
and was administered via a computer program developed in ColdFusion (see Appendix for sample items). 
First, participants were presented with a context statement (e.g., Los hermanos Wright construyeron el 
primer avión [“The Wright brothers built the first airplane”]) and then they were asked to complete the 
condition part of a conditional sentence by selecting the right verb form from a list of options (e.g., Hoy 
no podríamos viajar a Europa tan rápidamente si los Wright no ____________ el primer avión. [“We 
would not be able to travel to Europe so fast these days if the Wright brothers ____________ the first 
airplane”]). The consequence part of the sentence was always in the simple conditional tense. Thus, to fill 
in the blanks participants could only rely on understanding the initial context statement, rather than 
language cues. 
The experimental groups received different numbers of options per item (2 or 4) and practice items (28 or 
56). The task for the two-option groups included (a) the targeted structure, that is, the Spanish pluperfect 
subjunctive (e.g., no hubieran construido [“hadn’t built”]) and (b) the non-targeted structure, the Spanish 
imperfect subjunctive (e.g., no construyeran [“didn’t build”]). The four-option groups additionally 
included (c) the Spanish simple conditional (e.g., no construirían [“wouldn’t build”]) and (d) the Spanish 
perfect conditional (e.g., no habrían construido [“wouldn’t have built”]), alternating every other item 
with an ungrammatical version of the Spanish pluperfect subjunctive (e.g., *no habueran construido). As 
in Rosa and Leow (2004), only options (a) and (b) were possible answers throughout the treatment, 
respectively providing the right choice for the critical items—which elicited the targeted structure—and 
the distractors—which elicited the non-targeted structure. All options were presented in randomized 
order. The treatment for the 28-item group contained 18 critical items and 10 distractors, while the 56-
item group completed double as many items (36 critical items and 20 distractors). All experimental 
groups received concurrent feedback of the right/wrong type (“Cool!” and “Oops, try again!”). 
Assessment Tasks 
The assessment tasks included a 34-item multiple-choice recognition task and a 32-item controlled 
production task in the written mode, each with 20 critical items. The recognition task had the same 
structure as the experimental task, while the production task did not provide any options1. Pretests and 
posttests included the same items, in randomized order. 
Procedure 
On day one, all the participants completed the pretests and received basic preliminary instruction on the 
non-targeted structure. Participants who scored more than 3 correct items (out of 20) on the written 
recognition pretest and/or more than 0 correct items on the controlled written production pretest were 
excluded from the final pool. Two days later, the remaining 52 participants were randomly assigned to 
one of four treatment conditions, as per the interaction of the two experimental variables in the study: type 
of input-based practice (2 or 4 options) and amount of input-based practice (28 or 56 items). Henceforth, 
these groups will be referred to as 2x28, 4x28, 2x56, and 4x56. Before completing the treatment, 
Luis Cerezo Type and Amount of Input-Based Practice in CALI 
 
Language Learning & Technology  109  
participants were instructed to “think aloud” (i.e., verbalize whatever crossed their minds) throughout the 
entire experiment. To familiarize participants with the procedure, they received this instruction while 
performing a mathematical problem-solving task. Next, they completed the treatment, followed by the 
two assessment posttests. All posttests were administered in paper and pencil format. Participants were 
instructed to proceed as quickly as possible and to refrain from editing previous items2. To minimize 
exposure to the targeted structure, production tests were administered first. Participant think-alouds 
throughout the experiment were recorded using Apple’s Quick Time Pro software. Their mouse-click 
histories during the treatment were recorded by the ColdFusion application developed for this study. 
Scoring 
Each critical item of the recognition and production tests was worth 1 point. Participants received 1 point 
if they chose the correct answer and 0 points otherwise. As in Rosa and Leow (2004), agreement errors in 
production were not considered if intended use of the past perfect subjunctive was evident. Two raters 
scored all tests independently, with 98% inter-rater reliability. For the remaining 2% of mismatches, an 
agreed-upon solution was found. 
Coding of Treatment 
The mouse-clicking histories of each participant during the treatment were coded for accuracy of 
response, clicking order, and relative position of the clicked option in its list. As stated earlier (see 
Experimental task), similarly to Rosa and Leow (2004), two of the four options in the treatment were 
never the correct answers (henceforth impossible options, IMPs). Accordingly, four click types were 
distinguished: 
• [RIGHT]: If the clicked option was correct (pluperfect subjunctive in critical items; imperfect 
subjunctive in distractors). 
• [WRONG]: If the clicked option was incorrect but possible (imperfect subjunctive in critical 
items; pluperfect subjunctive in distractors). 
• [IMPa]: If the clicked option pertained to the first type of impossible options (ill-formed 
pluperfect subjunctive or well-formed perfect conditional). 
• [IMPb]: If the clicked option pertained to the second type of impossible options (well-formed 
simple conditional). 
When participants clicked on several options before responding correctly, their successive mouse-clicks 
were coded from left to right. The relative position of each clicked option in its list was coded 1 to 4 
(from top to bottom). For example, the sequence [(2) WRONG > (3) IMPb > (4) IMPa > (1) RIGHT] 
indicates that in order to fill in the blank successfully, the participant clicked on all four available options, 
starting with the WRONG one (which was second in the list), then clicking on IMPb (which was third), 
then IMPa (which was fourth), and finally the RIGHT one (which was first in the list). 
Analysis 
Item reliability analyses using Cronbach’s alpha were performed on all assessment tests. The reliability 
coefficients for the recognition pretests and posttests were .82 and .88, respectively, and the coefficient 
for the production posttest was .95 (no analyses were necessary for the production pretests since only 
participants scoring 0 on all items were admitted into the study). These coefficients were satisfactory, 
closely approaching or passing the .9 benchmark for highly reliable research (Nunnally & Bernstein, 
1994). 
To probe the two research questions (i.e., the effects of type and amount of computerized input-based 
practice on L2 development), the raw scores from the recognition and production tests were submitted to 
two independent 2x2 repeated-measures ANOVAs, entering time as the within-subject factor and type or 
amount of input-based practice as the between-subject factor (as discussed in the Results section, this

statistical model was chosen based on distribution of the data). ANOVA results were interpreted in light 
of the observed power (OP) and effect size (the magnitude of the impact of the independent variable on 
the dependent variable). As suggested by Volker (2006), in order to provide a more fine-grained analysis 
both the effect size of the omnibus test effects (i.e., for the whole ANOVA—partial eta-squared, ηp
2) and 
the post-hoc contrast effect sizes (pairwise group comparisons— standardized mean difference effects, 
Cohen’s d) were reported. An OP of .8 was considered acceptable. For ηp2, .01 was considered small, .06 
medium, and .14 large. For d, .40 was considered small, .70 medium, and 1.00 large3. The alpha level for 
all analyses of significance was set at .05. 
RESULTS 
Prior to running statistical analyses, the raw data on the assessment tests were checked for outliers 
following the outlier labeling rule in Hoaglin and Iglewicz (1987), and no outliers were identified. Visual 
inspection of the descriptive statistics in Table 3 and the plotted means in Figures 1 and 2 indicated that 
all four experimental conditions experienced learning of the targeted structure in both recognition and 
production tests. Combined gains were larger in recognition tests (13.96 out of 20 items) than production 
tests (11.44) but between-group differences were larger in the latter (4.46 items between the highest- and 
lowest-gaining groups versus 2 items in recognition tests). The top gainers in both tests were the 56-item 
groups. The ranking of groups in terms of gains was the same for both tests: 2x56 (14.69 in recognition 
and 14.15 in production) > 4x56 (14.54 and 11.92) > 4x28 (13.93 and 10) > 2x28 (12.69 and 9.69).

Before running parametric statistics to probe any significant effects or interactions in the results, the data 
were checked to ensure that assumptions of ANOVAs were met. Visual inspection of the distribution of 
the data in the Q-Q plots and acceptable skewness and kurtosis values (< absolute 1) indicated that the 
recognition and production scores in all four groups were normally distributed. Additionally, Levene’s 
test of equality of error variances indicated that the variance between groups was not statistically 
different, either for recognition F(3, 51) = .65, p = .587 or production F(3, 51) = .06, p = .9784. To 
observe whether there were any differences between groups prior to the treatment, a one-way ANOVA 
was run on the raw scores from the recognition pretests. No analysis was necessary for the production 
pretests, since only participants scoring 0 on all items were admitted into the study. The results of the

ANOVA indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between groups, F(3, 48) = .09,

RQ1. Effects of Type of Input-Based Practice 
With regard to the first research question (effects of type of input-based practice), the ANOVA performed 
on the scores from the recognition tests yielded a significant main effect for time, F(1, 50) = 470.07, p < 
.001, ηp
2 = .90, no significant main effect for type of input-based practice, F(1, 50) = .06, p = .807, ηp2 = 
.00, and no significant interaction Time × Type of input-based practice, F(1, 50) = .17, p = .678, ηp2 = .00 
(see Table 4). Similarly, the ANOVA performed on the scores from the production tests yielded a main 
effect for time, F(1, 50) = 131.49, p < .001, ηp2 = .72, no significant main effect for type of input-based 
practice, F(1, 50) = .23, p = .632, ηp2 = .00, and no significant interaction Time × Type of input-based 
practice, F(1, 50) = .23, p = .632, ηp2 = .00.

The significant main effects for time and the no significant interactions Time × Type of input-based 
practice in both recognition and production tests indicated that the 2- and 4-option groups experienced 
significant and similar learning of the targeted structure in both dependent measures. However, the lack of 
a statistical difference must be interpreted with caution due to the very low observed power (OP = .07 and 
.08) that resulted from the sample size (n = 13). As Oswald and Plonsky (2010, p. 86) noted: 
Researchers have a natural tendency to interpret significant statistics no matter what the sample 
size is […]. This practice should generally be avoided because conceptually, small samples 
usually represent very little of the population of interest, and empirically, small-sample statistics 
(even significant ones) are highly unstable. 
Along these lines, Neill (2008) noted that significance testing with small sample sizes can be misleading 
because it is subject to Type II errors (i.e., concluding that there is no effect of a treatment when there is 
in fact one), and suggested using means and standardized mean difference effect sizes as more 
informative measures. Following this suggestion, the standardized mean difference effect sizes between 
the 2- and 4-option groups were computed and compared. For recognition, d([2x28] × [4x28]) = .24 and 
d([2x56] × [4x56]) = .08. For production, d([2x28] × [4x28]) = .04 and d([2x56] × [4x56]) = .36. Based 
on Oswald and Plonsky’s (2010, p. 99) standards for effect sizes, only the latter comparison ([2x56] × 
[4x56]) approached a small effect (i.e., d = 36).

To further elucidate these results, the participant clicking histories in the 4-option groups (4x28 and 4x56) 
were analyzed. Figure 3 shows a visual representation of the total number of clicks on IMPs for the 
shared first 28 items. The white and black bars represent critical items (eliciting the targeted structure) 
and distractors (eliciting the non-targeted structure), respectively. As can be observed, all the peaks in the 
graph (i.e., the most frequently clicked options) correspond to distractors. This indicates that participants 
completed the experimental task in the following way: if the item was critical, participants narrowed 
down their choices to the two relevant options and rarely clicked on IMPs; however, if the item was a 
distractor, they clicked on the IMP options more often. Observation of the clicking order revealed that 
participants usually clicked on the targeted structure first, likely because critical items were more frequent 
(18 out of 28), but when they received negative feedback in a distractor they tried more options, including 
the IMPs. 
 
 
Figure 3. Number of clicks on IMPs by treatment item, including critical items (white bars), distractors 
(black bars), and clicking trends between critical items and distractors (red lines) (4x28 and 4x56 groups 
combined). 
Let us now look at the individual participants who clicked on IMPs, rather than the total number of clicks 
on IMPs. Figure 4 provides a visual representation of the number of participants in the 4x56 group (n = 
13) who clicked on IMPs throughout the treatment. As this graph illustrates, the number of participants 
clicking on IMPs ranged from zero (critical items 4, 13, 23, 26, 29, 34, 35, 36, 44, 46, 53) to six 
(distractor item 6). On average, only 1 out of 13 (7.7%) participants clicked on an IMP if the item was 
critical, while this number tripled (23%) if the item was a distractor. Dividing the treatment into its two 
halves does not change this pattern, but it reveals that participants gradually clicked on fewer IMPs. For 
critical items, the average number of participants who clicked on IMPs went from 1.3 (10%) in the first 
half to 0.8 (6%) in the second. For distractors, the number shifted from 3.5 (27%) to 2.6 (20%). 
Moreover, during the second half of the treatment (items 29–56) 92% of the participants clicked on IMPs 
on three occasions or fewer, which indicates that most of the participants identified the relevant options 
with great rates of success.

and distractors (black bars) (4x56 group) 
To sum up, based on the results from the ANOVAs and the standardized mean difference effect sizes it 
seems that the different numbers of options in the computerized input-based practice in Rosa and Leow 
(2004) and Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) did not have a differential effect on the development of the L2 
targeted form. Qualitative observation of participant mouse-click histories revealed that participants 
clicked on the additional options in Rosa and Leow very rarely, mostly upon encountering a distractor, 
and progressively fewer times as the treatment evolved. 
RQ2. Effects of Amount of Input-Based Practice 
With regard to the second research question (effects of amount of input-based practice), the ANOVA 
performed on the scores from the recognition tests yielded a significant main effect for time, F(1, 50) = 
478.26, p < .001, ηp2 = .90, no significant main effect for amount of input-based practice, F(1,50) = 1.25, 
p = .268, ηp2 = .02, and no significant interaction Time × Amount of input-based practice, F(1, 50) = 1.05, 
p = .311, ηp2 = .02 (see Table 5). Again, similar results were obtained for production, with a significant 
main effect for time, F(1, 50) = 137.91, p < .001, ηp2 = .73, no significant main effect for amount of input-
based practice, F(1, 50) = 2.68, p = .108, ηp2 = .05, and no significant interaction Time × Amount of 
input-based practice, F(1, 50) = 2.68, p = .108, ηp2 = .05.

The significant main effects for time and the no significant interactions Time × Amount of input-based 
practice in both recognition and production tests indicated that the 28- and 56-item groups experienced 
significant and similar learning of the targeted structure in both measures. These results must again be 
interpreted with caution due to the low observed power (OP = .17 and .36). In fact, the small (ηp2 = .02) to 
almost medium (ηp
2 = .05) effect sizes of the no significant interactions in recognition and production 
tests suggest that the larger gain differences of the 56-item groups (1.34 and 3.19 more items in 
recognition and production) are still worth noting. To probe deeper into these results, the standardized 
mean difference effect sizes between the 28- and 56-item groups were computed and compared. For 
recognition, d([2x28] × [2x56]) = .44 and d([4x28] × [4x56]) = .14. For production, d([2x28] × [2x56]) = 
.67 and d([4x28] × [4x56]) = .25. According to Oswald and Plonsky’s (2010, p. 99) standards, the 
standardized mean difference effect sizes between the 2x28 and 2x56 groups reached a small effect in 
recognition and a medium effect in production. Consequently, despite the finding of a no significant 
interaction Time × Amount of input-based practice, the larger mean gains of the 56-item groups and the 
observed small to medium effect sizes for the 2-option groups suggested that the higher amount of 
practice items completed by the right/wrong feedback group in Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) vis-à-vis 
Rosa and Leow (2004) might have added some edge in the development of the targeted form, particularly 
in production. 
DISCUSSION 
The first research question asked whether type of computerized input-based task, with either two or four 
options, as in Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) and Rosa and Leow (2004), respectively, had differential 
effects on L2 development. Since the present study was the first to investigate this issue, the null 
hypothesis was formulated. Quantitative results failed to reject the null hypothesis, with the 2- and 4-
option groups experiencing comparable learning achievement in recognition and production of the 
targeted form. Qualitative observation of participant mouse-click histories revealed that participants 
clicked on the additional options in the 4-option groups very rarely, mostly upon encountering a 
distractor, and progressively fewer times as the treatment evolved. 
To investigate why this happened, the participant think-alouds during the treatment phase were 
monitored. This revealed that participants were able to identify the targeted structure since very early in 
the treatment. For example, on item 6 one participant verbalized: 
Luis Cerezo Type and Amount of Input-Based Practice in CALI 
 
Language Learning & Technology  116  
Mi hermana Isabel sabe hablar italiano… Si Isabel… uh… I think it has to be past subjunctive… 
there’s only one past subjunctive that I see… 
As the treatment progressed, participants made even more explicit statements about the only two relevant 
options. For example, on item 42, another participant stated: 
Quiero viajar, I wanna like travel to Korea, but my [breath] Korean friend doesn’t invite me. 
[Tsk] [breath] I would travel to Korea… South Korea that is [breath] if mi amiga, if my friend… 
ah… had invited me. Hubiera invitado. Ooops. Invitara [breath]. There are only two that are past 
subjunctive, max on these. 
Therefore, the present study does not provide empirical support to Sanz and Morgan-Short’s (2004, p, 71) 
claim that the presence of additional options in Rosa and Leow’s (2004) experimental task may have 
impeded participants from noticing the target form. Evidence from participant mouse-click histories and 
think-aloud protocols showed that participants completing the 4-option task were able to identify the two 
relevant options (targeted and non-targeted forms) rather quickly through an elimination process. This is 
consistent with Leow (2000) and Hama and Leow (2010), in which think-aloud protocols gathered on the 
post-exposure assessment tasks revealed that some learners engaged in the strategy of eliminating several 
distracting options to arrive at the final one. Also, these findings underscore the role of learners as active 
agents in the learning process and the disconnect between what Ellis (2003) and Seedhouse (2005) call 
task-as-a-workplan (i.e., what teachers/researchers think the task will do) and task-as-a-process (i.e., 
what learners actually do) or, in terms of sociocultural and activity theorists (e.g., Coughlan & Duff, 
1994), the disconnect between tasks and activities (see, e.g., Dooly, 2011 for recent empirical evidence). 
The second research question asked whether amount of input-based practice (28 items, as in Rosa & 
Leow, 2004 versus 56 items, as in Sanz & Morgan-Short, 2004) had differential effects on L2 
development. Based on previous empirical literature, it was hypothesized that learners completing 56 
items of a computerized task with right/wrong feedback would outperform those completing 28 items. 
While the larger gains of the 56-item groups in recognition (1.34 more items) and production (3.19 more 
items) did not reach statistical significance, the small to medium effect sizes observed suggested that 
these differences may reach significance with a larger population, particularly in production. 
On the one hand, these results provide partial support to the growing body of literature showing that task-
repetition in combination with corrective feedback has beneficial effects on accuracy (Adams, 2003; 
Sheppard, 2006; Leow, 1998). The fact that the extra practice helped more in production than recognition 
is probably because input-processing (comprehension, recognition, or interpretation) is less challenging 
than output production (see, e.g., Flynn, 1986), and thus 28 items sufficed to attain an already high level 
of recognition accuracy (76% versus 49% production accuracy). 
On the other hand, it is surprising that the extra practice did not have larger effects, particularly because 
there was room for improvement (3.4 and 6.96 items in recognition and production posttests, 
respectively). Based on informal post-debriefing interviews with the participants, it was posited that the 
extra practice might not have produced the expected effects because it induced fatigue and/or boredom. 
Indeed, the think-alouds in the 56-item groups provided many instances of participants who complained 
about the large number of items, both during the treatment and posttests. Observe, for example, the 
following verbalizations of participant Pupi (not her real name): 
[Treatment item #22:] Las vacaciones se han terminado. Muchos estudiantes estarían todavía en 
casa de su familia si las vacaciones se… de su familia… terminaran? Huh? Hubieran terminado? 
[stretching] I’m bored! 
Luis Cerezo Type and Amount of Input-Based Practice in CALI 
 
Language Learning & Technology  117  
[ Treatment item #46:] habría limpiado la casa si… If he had time? No? Uh…. How many more 
left? [sigh] Uh… 
[Treatment item #51, addressing her neighbor:] How many, how many are on here? I’m on like 
51! Is that right? [Neighbor:] Mine just stopped and said thank you for completing the survey. 
[Pupi:] OH MY GOD!!! [laughter] This is not ending!!! [laughter] [Neighbor:] Yeah, mine didn’t 
have that many [Pupi:] Erm… [addressing one researcher] Hi, er… how many questions are 
there? [Researcher:] Oh, you’re almost done, you’re almost done [laughter]. [Pupi:] Ok 
[Researcher:] Yeah, yeah [Pupi:] I was like wondering [Researcher laughs]. 
[Treatment item #56:] Oh God! 
[Production posttest item #12, after turning the page and discovering more questions:] Oh, 
dammit! [sigh] [puff] 
In their study, Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) claimed: “Perhaps if the amount of practice in [Rosa and 
Leow (2004)] had been greater, the [right/wrong feedback] group would not have performed significantly 
[worse than] the other groups.” While the present study suggests that this is possible, it also underscores 
that 56 items in one batch may induce fatigue and/or boredom, which may in turn decrease the effects of 
the extra practice. Maybe if the extra practice had been administered in different sessions, with time 
lapses in between, as in Leow (1998), higher accuracy gains would have been observed. 
Taken together, the results from the present study suggest that of the two variables under investigation, 
type and amount of input-based practice, only the latter may possibly contribute to explaining why the 
right/wrong feedback group in Sanz and Morgan-Short attained learning gains comparable to their 
feedback group with grammatical explanations. However, the small to medium effect sizes observed here 
(d = .44 and .67) do not make up for the large effect sizes observed in Rosa and Leow (2004). The 
standardized mean difference effect sizes between their right/wrong feedback group and the group that 
received feedback with grammatical explanations reached d values of 1.31 and 1.69 in recognition of old 
and new items and 2.68 and 1.36 in production of old and new items, respectively. Hence, there must be 
additional variables, other than amount of practice, that explain the conflicting findings between Rosa and 
Leow and Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004), as explained in the next section. 
LIMITATIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH 
As with all studies, there are certain methodological limitations that should be noted. First, the number of 
participants per group was relatively low (n = 13). Perhaps if the sample size had been larger the mean 
differences between the 28- and 56-item groups would have reached significance. Second, assessment 
measures included immediate written recognition and production only, did not include a “Don’t know” 
option, and were administered in printed form. Future studies may want to include delayed posttests using 
a wider variety of dependent measures, assess whether or not learners were guessing, and preclude 
backtracking more effectively. And third, while the use of mouse-click tracking and think-alouds proved 
very valuable to uncover the learning behavior of the participants, it may be more effective to record both 
of them under one single (synchronized) track via multimedia screen-capture software. 
The present study also opened some avenues for further research. First, future studies may want to 
investigate the effects of additional practice in several batches to diminish the potentially detrimental 
effects of fatigue or boredom. Second, it would be very interesting to use effective ways of 
operationalizing and measuring fatigue and boredom and analyze their potential effects on L2 
development through correlational research. Think-alouds offer valuable information but are not ideal, 
because not all participants verbalize their feelings. Perhaps these data could be triangulated with surveys 
Luis Cerezo Type and Amount of Input-Based Practice in CALI 
 
Language Learning & Technology  118  
and more sophisticated measures of fatigue, like electroencephalographic measures and response tests in 
visual display terminal tasks (Cheng & Hsu, 2011). Third, differences in amount of practice, as suggested 
earlier, may not be solely responsible for the conflicting findings between the two studies compared here 
(and the remaining studies on the effects of type of computerized feedback). The picture interpretation 
task in Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) might have promoted stronger form-meaning connections than the 
merely textual multiple-choice task in Rosa and Leow (2004). Future studies should investigate the 
effects of different types of input-based tasks beyond their number of options. Finally, type of targeted 
structure may also exert a moderating role. The studies that found superior performance for feedback with 
grammatical explanations targeted Japanese particles and passivization (Nagata, 1993), Japanese reflexive 
constructions (Sachs, 2011), Latin assignment of semantic functions (Lado et al., 2014; Lin, 2009), 
Spanish dative experiencer constructions with gustar (Bowles, 2008), Spanish past counterfactual 
conditional sentences (Rosa & Leow, 2004), and Spanish present subjunctive and preposition pied-piping 
in adjectival relative clauses (Cerezo, 2010). In contrast, the studies that found comparable performance 
for right/wrong feedback targeted Spanish noun-adjective gender and number agreement (Camblor, 
2006), Spanish direct object pronouns (Moreno, 2007; Sanz & Morgan-Short, 2004), and Spanish dative 
experiencer constructions with gustar (Hsieh, 2008). Hulstijn and de Graaff (1994) argued that 
metalinguistic explanations give an edge when the targeted structures are more complex. Perhaps the 
structures in Rosa and Leow and the studies that align with it were more complex than those in the group 
of studies like Sanz and Morgan-Short (though see Bowles, 2008 vs. Hsieh, 2008 for gustar). Clearly, 
future studies must investigate the effects of different types of computerized feedback on different 
targeted structures (see, e.g., Cerezo, 2010). 
CONCLUSIONS  
The theoretical and methodological contributions of this study have implications for research on, and the 
development of, the ever more present hybrid and online L2 learning programs. From a theoretical 
standpoint, this study suggests that the conflicting findings in the literature on type of computerized 
feedback (the effects of right/wrong feedback versus feedback with grammatical explanations) might be 
due to differences in experimental treatments. Addressing claims by Sanz and Morgan-Short (2004) and 
partially replicating Rosa and Leow (2004), this study concluded that the superior performance of the 
feedback with grammatical explanations in Rosa and Leow might have been due to the inferior amount of 
computerized practice provided, which may have put the right/wrong feedback group at a disadvantage. 
Possibly, however, this was not the only reason. Differences in the type of practice and the targeted 
structure may also have contributed to these conflicting findings. 
From a methodological perspective, this study underscored the importance of triangulating data. Measures 
of online behavior (mouse-click tracking and think-alouds) were helpful to uncover learner strategies 
evidencing the mismatch between the notions of task-as-a-workplan and task-as-a-process, as well as the 
increased boredom and fatigue induced by the extra amount of practice. Similarly, the use of descriptive 
statistics and standardized mean difference effect sizes proved very useful to reinterpret the results of 
significance tests, which in the case of small sample sizes may propel Type II errors.

NOTES 
1. An anonymous reviewer pointed out that the absence of a “Not sure/Don’t know” option in the 
recognition task “could have potentially skewed results since students were forced to pick an option even 
if that meant they needed to guess.” While this is certainly possible, including such option would have 
altered the partial replication nature of this study, as neither Sanz and Morgan Short (2004) nor Rosa and 
Leow (2004) included it. Future studies, however, need to address the role of “Not sure/Don’t know” 
options in input-based tasks. 
2. An anonymous reviewer suggested that the paper-and-paper pencil nature of the assessment tests does 
not guarantee that participants did not backtrack, contrary to the instructions they received. This is 
possible but unlikely because the laboratory was constantly proctored by the researcher and two 
assistants. Also, the think-alouds did not reveal any cases of backtracking. 
3. The coefficients for OP and ηp2 were based on Cohen (1988). The coefficients for Cohen’s d were 
based on Oswald and Plonsky’s (2010, p. 99) revision of Cohen’s (1988) benchmarks due to their more 
conservative nature (they require an additional .20 for every category). It should be noted, however, that 
these revised coefficients constitute “a preliminary and general set of SLA standards for effect sizes” 
(Oswald & Plonsky, 2010, p. 99). 
4. Tests of normality of distribution cannot be interpreted with reliable confidence with small sample 
sizes. For that reason, statistical analyses were also performed with a nonparametric statistical model 
(Kruskal-Wallis on learning gains). Results did not differ from the ANOVA analyses reported here. 
 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
I would like to thank Rebecca Sachs, Alison Mackey, and Donna Lardiere for their comments on earlier 
versions of this paper. I am also very grateful to the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful 
feedback, Roberto Gómez Fernández and Boram Suh for their help with data gathering, and the students 
who participated in this study. All errors are of course my own.

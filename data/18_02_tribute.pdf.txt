TRIBUTE TO MARK WARSCHAUER 
Dorothy Chun, University of California, Santa Barbara 
Mark Warschauer had the prescience and inspiration in 1997 to found the first open access journal for 
research in computer-assisted language learning. He served as Editor or Co-Editor of Language Learning 
& Technology from 1997-2003 and again from 2011-2014. It has been my honor and privilege to have 
been Co-Editor since 2000 and to have worked with such an accomplished and highly respected 
visionary.  
According to our records, in 1998 LLT had more than 1,000 readers worldwide. To date, there are 21,215 
official subscribers, and the journal’s website had an average of 2,569 visit per day in 2013, with 937,913 
visits during the year. Since 2003, LLT has been indexed in the exclusive Institute for Scientific 
Information's (ISI) Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), ISI Alerting Services, Social SciSearch, and 
Current Contents/Social and Behavioral Sciences. The European Reference Index for the Humanities 
(ERIH) classifies LLT  as “INT2” in the field of Pedagogical and Educational research, that is, an 
international publication “with significant visibility and influence in the various research domains in 
different countries.” Since 2009 the journal has been ranked among the top 10% of all Linguistics and 
Education journals.

What has always impressed me throughout all the years that I have known and worked with Mark are his 
vast and broad knowledge, his extraordinary energy and insight, his ability to keep abreast of cutting edge 
theory and practice in both education and technology, and his eagerness to take on new challenges. 
Language Learning & Technology would not exist without Mark’s vision, and it would not enjoy its 
current stature without his leadership. I am grateful to Mark both professionally and personally and wish 
him the very best as he embarks on his next adventure, being at the helm as the inaugural editor of a new 
journal, AERA Open.

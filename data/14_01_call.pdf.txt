Call for Papers for Special Issue of LLT 
 
Theme: Learner Autonomy and New Learning Environments 
 
Guest Editors: Hayo Reinders and Cynthia White 
 
This special issue of Language Learning & Technology will focus on the relationship between technology 
and learner autonomy. The affordances and constraints offered by new learning environments, whether in 
mobile, immersive, distance, or other forms of learning, often place greater, and in many cases different, 
demands on learners’ ability to manage their own learning. At the same time, they can also offer greater 
potential to support learners in the learning process. We are inviting submission for papers that explore 
these affordances and constraints and the development of autonomy. Papers should be grounded in a 
theoretical framework that formulates research hypotheses and then seeks to confirm or disconfirm them 
by following an appropriate research methodology (http://llt.msu.edu/resguide.html). 
 
Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: 
• Metacognitive demands of new learning environments  
• New ways of using technology to foster autonomy  
• Technology and social aspects of autonomy, e.g., social networking  
• Effects and outcomes of technology use in relation to learner autonomy 
• Sociocultural inquiry into autonomy-related aspects of learning through technology  
• Technology and the measurement of autonomy 
 
Please send an email of intent with a 500-word abstract by March 20, 2010 to llted@hawaii.edu.

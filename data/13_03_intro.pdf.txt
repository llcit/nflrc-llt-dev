About Language Learning & Technology 
Language Learning & Technology is a refereed journal which began publication in July 1997. The journal 
seeks to disseminate research to foreign and second language educators in the US and around the world 
on issues related to technology and language education. 
• Language Learning & Technology is sponsored and funded by the University of Hawai'i National 
Foreign Language Resource Center (NFLRC) and the Michigan State University Center for 
Language Education And Research (CLEAR), and is co-saponsored by the Center for Applied 
Linguistics (CAL).  
• Language Learning & Technology is a fully refereed journal with an editorial board of scholars in 
the fields of second language acquisition and computer-assisted language learning. The focus of 
the publication is not technology per se, but rather issues related to language learning and 
language teaching, and how they are affected or enhanced by the use of technologies.  
• Language Learning & Technology is published exclusively on the World Wide Web. In this way, 
the journal seeks to (a) reach a broad audience in a timely manner, (b) provide a multimedia 
format which can more fully illustrate the technologies under discussion, and (c) provide 
hypermedia links to related background information.  
• Beginning with Volume 7, Number 1, Language Learning & Technology is indexed in the 
exclusive Institute for Scientific Information's (ISI) Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), ISI 
Alerting Services, Social Scisearch, and Current Contents/Social and Behavioral Sciences. 
• Language Learning & Technology is currently published three times per year (February, June, 
and October).

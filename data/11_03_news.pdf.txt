Ke kakaen raong wikpaesaeng kaen? Ke kakaen ihsingihdi wikpaesaeng kaen? by Ryoko Hattori & 
Dayne Lemuel. This simple and colorful Pingelapese word book grew out of the authors' participation in 
the University of Hawai'i's Language Documentation Project. The Project's mission is to help safeguard 
minority languages for which basic literacy documents, such as grammars and dictionaries, are either 
inadequate or nonexistent.

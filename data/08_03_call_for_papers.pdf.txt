Call for Papers for Special Issue of LLT
Theme: Electronic Literacy
Guest Editor: Carla Meskill
This special issue of Language Learning & Technology will examine the many issues related to electronic
literacy, especially as it applies to second language learning. While it is clear that what we see and hear
on television and computer screens is unique from what we read in print, frameworks for conceptualizing,
analyzing, and integrating into instructional practices the ways we understand the world through these
media are lacking. What processes constitute our reading of these electronic texts? What does it mean and
will it mean to be electronically literate? How do the experiences we have with what we see and interact
with on screens influence language use? In what way is electronic literacy impacting the ways we use,
teach, and learn language?
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
• Influences of socialization processes with and through electronic texts on second language
learning
• Use of linguistic/paralinguistic strategies with electronic texts
• Mediation of first language literacy practices in second language interactions with electronic texts
• Frameworks and/or processes for seeking, retrieving and making use of electronic texts
• Second language learners' electronic literacy development in classroom or out-of-school settings
• Language educators' understandings of electronic literacy and integration of electronic literacy in
the classroom

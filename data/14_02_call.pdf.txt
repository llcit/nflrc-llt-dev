Theme: Hegemonies in CALL 
 
Guest Editors: Marie-Noëlle Lamy and Mark Pegrum 
 
An assumption that the technologies, pedagogies, educational and sociocultural norms associated with 
CALL are universal has implicitly permeated much of the discipline’s research over the past two decades. 
In this issue we will draw together critical perspectives that problematize the workings of hegemonies. By 
“hegemony,” we understand a situation where one culture or one form of praxis predominates and, 
deliberately or not, prevents the development or continued viability of alternative cultures and forms of 
praxis. We will assemble a provocative collection, from a multicultural, multilingual group of 
contributors, contrasting voices from the Anglosphere with voices from less well-served 
territories/cultures to ensure a rich dialogue between and around articles. We particularly welcome 
proposals for articles that include less well-researched languages, student cohorts and teaching contexts.  
Please consult the LLT Website for general guidelines on submission (http://llt.msu.edu/contrib.html) and 
research (http://llt.msu.edu/resguide.html).  
 
Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 
• CALL & technological hegemonies (including hegemonic implications of the Internet and Web, 
commonly used Web 2.0 tools, and mobile technologies) 
• CALL & pedagogical hegemonies (including hegemonic implications of social constructivism and 
associated interactive, collaborative, student-centred pedagogies; curriculum and course design; and 
the design of open access materials and digital repositories) 
• CALL & educational hegemonies (including hegemonic educational and institutional policies, 
expectations and norms) 
• CALL & social hegemonies (including the hegemonic implications of norms and practices of online 
interaction) 
• CALL & inter/cultural hegemonies (including hegemonic implications of  Western cultural norms 
and Western approaches to tolerance, openness, relativism and the skills associated with intercultural 
competence) 
• CALL & sociopolitical hegemonies (including the hegemonic implications of democratic structures in 
education, and resistance to hegemonies)
